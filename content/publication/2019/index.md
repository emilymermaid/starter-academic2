abstract: Collaborating using a common language can be challenging for non-native speakers (NNS). These challenges can be reduced when native speakers (NS) adjust their speech behavior for NNS, for example by speaking more slowly. In this study, we examined whether the use of real-time speech rate feedback (a speech speedometer) would help NS monitor their speaking speed and adjust for NNS accordingly. We conducted a laboratory experiment with 20 triads of 2 NS and 1 NNS. NS in half of the groups were given the speech speedometer. We found that NS with the speech speedometer were significantly more motivated to slow down their speech but they did not actually speak more slowly, although they made other speech adjustments. Furthermore, NNS perceived the speech of NS with the speedometer less clear, and they felt less accommodated. The results highlight the need for tools that create scaffolding to help NS make speech accommodations. We conclude with some design ideas for these scaffolding tools.
