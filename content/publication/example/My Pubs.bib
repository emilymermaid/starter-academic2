	abstract = {When non-native English speakers ({NNS}) encounter messages they do not understand, they are often reluctant to ask native speakers ({NS}) for clarification. In this paper, we explored whether a conversation agent that asks clarification questions would increase {NNS}’ willingness to ask questions. We compared two agents: one that asked for clarification about specific message elements and one that asked general clarification questions. {NNS} and {NS} rated how disruptive the agent was, the quality of the conversation, and whether they would feel embarrassed to ask their own questions. {NNS} found both types of agent less disruptive than {NS} did, but both found the specific agent more disruptive than the generic agent. {NS} rated the conversations higher in quality than {NNS}, but there was no effect of agent condition. We discuss potential of using conversational agents to boost {NNS}’s confidence in conversation.},

	abstract = {What is it that makes humor difficult to understand and appreciate in a second language (L2)? Despite advances in research in both L2 pragmatics and humor studies, scholars have as yet had little to say on this topic. In interviews, learners themselves pinpoint culture, vocabulary, and the speed at which playful talk often takes place as difficulties. Yet, as we know, hypothetical selfreports of language use can be quite unreliable. Thus, this exploratory study aimed to examine L2 understanding of humor more systematically. Six advanced non-native speakers ({NNSs}) of English kept diaries in which they recorded their experiences with humor in English over an eight-week period. Group meetings were also held every two weeks during this time to allow the participants to elaborate on, interpret, and discuss their experiences. For the present study, all instances of failed humor were extracted and coded. These were used to construct a typology of failed humor, which identifies seven levels at which a speaker may fail to successfully engage in a humorous exchange. The data suggest that {NNS} failures differ from those of {NSs} largely from a quantitative, but not qualitative, standpoint.},

There is scant research on how appreciation and production relate, and their relation to individual differences. Participants (N = 159) rated the humor of captioned cartoons and created captions for different cartoons. People who wrote funnier captions were less amused by the professionally-captioned cartoons. Production ﬂuency, in contrast, was not related to appreciation. Personality predicted humor appreciation, but not production success. Demographics predicted production success, but not appreciation. Appreciation and production success appear to rely on separable mechanisms and motivations. Our results were also inconsistent with the idea that humor creators are motivated by dominance and humor appreciators by afﬁliation.},

The purpose of the present paper is to open the discussion of this phenomenon through the examination of a corpus of 186 responses to failed humor. These responses, which were elicited through the telling of a joke found to be lacking in humor for most hearers, were classiﬁed by type and affective sense (positive, negative, and neutral). The data were also categorized by the sociolinguistic variables of age, gender, and social relationship. The ﬁndings indicate that responses to failed humor go well beyond the typical groans or fake laughter, that are often asserted as prototypical reactions in the literature, with laughter, metalinguistic comments, and interjections as the most common responses. In addition, no signiﬁcant differences were found in response types according to age or gender; however, very strong effects were found for social relationship, with negative reactions more common among intimates and neutral reactions preferred by acquaintances and strangers.},

Bell (2009a,b) used an unfunny joke to elicit responses in order to describe reactions that an attempt at humor receives when the joke is not appreciated. The present paper adopts those methods to explore responses to a joke that failed because it was not understood by the recipient. A total of 278 responses were elicited using a joke that was impossible for most hearers to comprehend without explanation. The most common reactions included non-verbal responses, explicit expressions of non-understanding (e.g. ‘‘I don’t get it’’), laughter, silence, and repetition of the punch line. Significant differences were found in examining the responses by the sociolinguistic variables of gender and social relationship, but not age.},

Using an empirical approach to item selection, 150 items were administered over the internet to an international (largely Australian) sample of 339 individuals in a range of occupations. Exploratory factor analysis produced an initial questionnaire comprising eight scales. Study 2 administered the questionnaire, and several other self-report instruments, to a second sample of 377 working Australians. The eight confirmed scales were validated. Also using confirmatory factor analysis, the initial questionnaire was reduced to a final 13-item instrument comprising two scales: Pleasant Climate and Unpleasant Climate. These scales were independent of age, gender, education, and position. They were also independent of the factors of the Big Five, mood measures of positive and negative affect, social desirability, and altruism. Since Unpleasant Climate was positively correlated with the Climate of Fear measure of Ashkanasy and Nicholson (2003), and Pleasant Climate with the Affiliative and Self-Enhancing humor styles from Martin et al.’s (2003) Humor Styles Questionnaire, the {HAW} provides a useful measure of humor within the workplace environment.},

Widespread use of some of these tools, such as instant messaging and group chat, coupled with the increasingly availability of wireless Internet access, have created new opportunities for using these collaboration tools by people sharing physical spaces in real time. Such ‘digital backchannels’ affect interactions and experiences in a variety of ways, depending on the spaces, the participants, and the relationships among them. We focus on the space of an academic conference, a physical space designed for voluntary participation by people with shared interests, seeking to share knowledge and connect with others. We present and analyze system logs and interview data from a recent conference, highlight some of the advantages and disadvantages experienced both by those who used the tools and by those who did not, and discuss implications and considerations for future use and research.},

Further, we propose that managerial support for humor mediates the relationship between {POS} and employees’ positive and negative humor climate. Finally, we hypothesize that as a way of making sense of the organization, humor climate should be related to organizational identiﬁcation.

An analysis of use shows that the group functionality was used primarily for bursts of synchronous conversations and occasional asynchronous exchanges. The content was primarily focused on work tasks, and negotiating availability, with a smattering of non-work topics and humor. Nearly all groups were remarkably similar in the content of their group chat, although the research group chatted far more frequently than the others.

The understanding of humor, perhaps because it is more difficult to document, has received somewhat less attention, especially from a sociolinguistic perspective. The present paper addresses this gap by using examples of humor in crosscultural interaction to propose ways in which two earlier models suggesting how humor is perceived (Carrell 1997) and supported (Hay 2001) may be further developed. These examples show that joke competence is a somewhat dynamic construct, that understanding can be partial and that lack of full understanding need not preclude appreciation. In addition, I suggest that interlocutors’ understanding of the wide variety of functions of humor must also be taken into consideration in any broader theory of how humor is perceived and understood. As understanding, like language use, is interactively constructed, I call for a view of humor comprehension that is social, as well as cognitive.},

This paper reports on a study that examined humor in interaction between native and non-native speakers of English and found that humor did not seem to be a cause of conﬂict because of adjustments speakers made to their speech and their situated interpretations of meaning. In general, taboo topics and potentially dangerous forms of humor were avoided and humor was carefully contextualized.

	abstract = {What is it that makes humor difficult to understand and appreciate in a second language (L2)? Despite advances in research in both L2 pragmatics and humor studies, scholars have as yet had little to say on this topic. In interviews, learners themselves pinpoint culture, vocabulary, and the speed at which playful talk often takes place as difficulties. Yet, as we know, hypothetical selfreports of language use can be quite unreliable. Thus, this exploratory study aimed to examine L2 understanding of humor more systematically. Six advanced non-native speakers ({NNSs}) of English kept diaries in which they recorded their experiences with humor in English over an eight-week period. Group meetings were also held every two weeks during this time to allow the participants to elaborate on, interpret, and discuss their experiences. For the present study, all instances of failed humor were extracted and coded. These were used to construct a typology of failed humor, which identifies seven levels at which a speaker may fail to successfully engage in a humorous exchange. The data suggest that {NNS} failures differ from those of {NSs} largely from a quantitative, but not qualitative, standpoint.},

	abstract = {Research has shown that native speakers ({NSs}) are generally capable of adjusting their language to make it appropriate for a non-native speaker ({NNS}) interlocutor’s proﬁciency. Very little is known in general about humorous interaction in intercultural communication, and in particular little is known about whether, how, and what types of conversational adjustments are made during such interaction. The research presented here suggests that the adjustments made by {NSs} during conversational humor often may not be appropriate for the {NNS}. In fact, in this type of communication, {NSs} who do not have experience in intercultural communication may actually overestimate the amount and types of adjustments that are necessary, thus underestimating the second language (L2) user’s proﬁciency. The result is that the L2 user sometimes gets marginalized and constructed as less than competent during playful interaction. This paper reports on a case study of one L2 user who, due to the interactional adjustments that were made when humor was used, was often positioned in marginalizing ways by interlocutors who were inexperienced in intercultural communication.},

The study adopts ethnography of communication approach to data collection and analysis. My original data consist of three hours of audio-taped interactions among a group of four female friends who come from different countries and are engaged in ordinary social conversations, reﬂecting on the world through language socialization. The emphasis lies on their use of teasing and disagreement as educational tools rather than conﬂict indicators and the implementation of these tools to maintain a strong relationship, raise cultural awareness, and gain knowledge of the world. The data show that teasing and disagreement can be used jointly not only to establish relational identity display and development but also to reafﬁrm a preexisting one and to elaborate on topics that lead to scope expansion and acquisition of new notions that have not been encountered previously. These conversations create an atmosphere for scaffolding and learning, not only about language but also about other cultures and other peoples’ behavior and pragmatics. Out of such socializations, new norms may evolve and new identities may emerge. Therefore, this study intends to encourage teaching L2 in natural settings where students can communicate their ideas freely without any limitations.},

Humor is important in our daily experiences. We ourselves and our daily conversational partners are expected to have a sense of humor. We cannot maintain friendly relationships with family members, friends, and colleagues without having this sense of humor. Humor is one of the most appreciated traits in human–human interaction. In this chapter, we investigate the possible role of humor in smart environments or, from an opposite perspective, how smart digital technology, its sensors, and actuators can help to introduce humorous situations and interactions in digitally enhanced physical worlds. With these words in mind, we discuss accidental, spontaneous, scripted, and staged humor. We will also draw upon humor as it appears nowadays in artiﬁcial physical environments, such as video game environments.

To address this problem, we conducted an online evaluation of 30 dialog jokes from different sources by almost 300 participants – volunteers and Mechanical Turk workers. We collected joke ratings along with participants’ age, gender, and language proficiency. Results show that demographics and joke topics can partly explain variation in humor judgments.

In an interview study of nine native English-speaking and 33 non-native English-speaking students at a large U.S. university, we explore how native language shapes patterns of informal interaction. We found that non-native speakers generally preferred interacting informally with fellow speakers of their own native language as opposed to native English speakers, which hinders communication and collaboration between groups. Three factors led to this “clustering” effect: issues of common ground, feelings of social obligation to other speakers of one’s native language, and desires to build social networks within a language group. Four factors led to greater motivation for cross-language interaction: a desire to build bridging capital, physical proximity, oneon-one or small-group interaction, and an established work relationship. The findings suggest ways that communication tools might reduce barriers to informal interaction between speakers of different native languages.},

Participants were less trusting of both the robot and the person in a human-robot relationship where the robot was dominant toward the person than when the person was dominant toward the robot; these differences were not found for a human pair. In Study 2, participants watched videos of a human confederate having an everyday conversation with either another human confederate or a humanoid robot. Participants who saw a confederate mirror the gestures of a robot found the robot less attractive than when the robot mirrored the confederate; the opposite effect was found for a human pair.

The present study challenges this perspective with a laboratory experiment grounded in the principles of Interpersonal Theory, a psychological approach to interpersonal dynamics. Participants had a text-based, structured conversation with a computer that gave scripted conversational responses. The main manipulation was whether participants were told that they were interacting with a computer program or a person in the room next door. Discourse analyses revealed a key difference in participants’ behavior – when participants believed they were talking to a person, they showed many more of the kinds of behaviors associated with establishing the interpersonal nature of a relationship. This finding has important implications for the design of technologies intended to take on social roles or characteristics.},

In an experiment (N = 48), dominant and submissive subjects were randomly matched with either a dominant or submissive computer. When a computer was endowed with the properties associated with dominance or submissiveness, subjects recognized the computer’s personality type along only that dimension. In addition, subjects not only preferred the similar computer, but they were more satisfied with the interaction. The findings demonstrate that personality does not require richly defined agents, sophisticated pictorial representations, natural language processing, or artificial intelligence.},

In a 2x2 between-participants Wizard of Oz laboratory experiment with (N=68) high-school students we specifically examined how this prototyping agent’s expression of interest affected perceptions of the agent and learning outcomes dependent on the embodiment of the agent as embedded in the prototyping material itself or as an external entity. We found evidence that embedding an agent into the prototyping material can positively influence learning processes and outcomes while not harming perceptions of the agent.},

Faultlines, formed along the dimensions of asymmetries in lingua franca fluency, location, and nationality of team members, were associated with subgrouping in some but not all of the teams. Our findings suggest that divisive subgroup dynamics occurred only in teams that also suffered from power contests, suggesting that power contests activate otherwise dormant faultlines. Our findings extend theory on subgroup dynamics in global teams by adding language as a potential faultline dimension, showing how power struggles activated faultlines and were, in turn, reinforced by them and documenting the emotion-regulation processes triggered by subgrouping and enacted through language-related choices and behaviors.},

One hundred and sixty Iranian {EFL} learners in three language institutes in the centre of Iran participated in the study.

Data from {FLCAS} and {CF} questionnaires showed that the observed differences between the two groups were not signiﬁcant. All in all, the results indicated that regardless of their anxiety level both groups had similar beliefs about {CF} and strongly favoured receiving frequent {CF} in English oral communication classes when they were made aware of the purpose, signiﬁcance, and types of {CF} as suggested by Ellis (2009).

	abstract = {The construct of anxiety is often believed to be the affective factor with the greatest potential to pervasively affect the learning process (Horwitz, 2001), and recent research has demonstrated that anxiety can mediate whether learners are able to notice feedback and subsequently produce output (Sheen, 2008). In order to reduce the negative effects of anxiety, researchers have suggested that computer-based interaction may be an ideal medium for communication and practice (Kern, 1995), although this hypothesis has yet to be tested empirically. The current study addresses this gap by comparing the effect of computer-mediated communication ({CMC}) vs. faceto-face communication ({FTF}) on learners’ state anxiety. Twenty-five learners of intermediate Spanish completed two information-gap tasks with their teacher in a within-subject, counterbalanced design. Learners’ state anxiety was measured halfway through and following each task via a state anxiety questionnaire, and a task preference questionnaire was administered after the treatment. Results demonstrate that – contrary to expectations – reported state anxiety was not significantly lower in the {CMC} mode than the {FTF} mode. In fact, learners’ reported state anxiety was comparable across modality. The use and implications of both interactional modes for foreign language learning contexts are discussed, as are students’ perceptions of interaction in the {CMC} and {FTF} modes.},

Therefore, situated within the context of a Japanese foreign language university which exhibits a dependency on ‘native-speaker’ English teachers from inner-circle (Kachru, 1985) countries, this paper showcases a social psychological study undertaken with 120 Japanese English language learners which sought to explore various dimensions of imagined intercultural contact via evaluations of the self and three intercultural others of different racial and ethnic appearance across two speciﬁc contact situations (positive and neutral). The outcomes are discussed in relation to underlying theories, as well as to the practical implications created for the improvement of foreign language teaching and learning practices which speciﬁcally seek to incorporate an explicit intercultural dimension.},

Especially when audio signals become distorted, {NNS} are overburdened by not only having to communicate with imperfect language skills, but also compensating for the deteriorations. Under these faulty audio conditions, {NNS} need to pay extra time and effort to understand the conversation. In order to give {NNS} more time to process conversations, we tested the insertion of silent gaps (from 0.2 to 0.4 seconds) between conversational turns. First, gaps were inserted into a previously taped conversation, resulting in a significant improvement of {NNS}'s understanding of the conversation. Second, gaps were inserted during a real-time audio conference by adding artificial delay between native speakers. The results show that the added delays have a combination of beneficial and detrimental effects for both native and non-native speakers. The findings have implications towards how audio conferencing can be improved for {NNS}.},

We conducted a laboratory experiment in which {NS} and {NNS} of English collaborated via audio conferencing on a map navigation task. Triads of one {NS} guider, one {NS} follower, and one {NNS} follower performed the task using one of three awareness displays: (a) a no awareness display that showed only the automated transcripts, (b) a general awareness display that showed whether each follower was reading the automated transcripts and/or translating a word; or (c) a detailed awareness display that showed which line of the transcripts a follower was reading and/or which words he/she was translating. {NS} guiders and {NNS} followers collaborated most successfully with the detailed awareness display, while {NS} guiders and {NS} followers performed equally across conditions.

Even though automated speech recognition ({ASR}) transcripts provide support to {NNS}, such transcripts may contain errors and impose the need to simultaneously listen and read. To reduce this burden, we propose adding another channel (i.e., highlighting) through which {NS} can help {NNS} by highlighting the critical parts of transcripts, thus making them more useful to {NNS}. In a laboratory study involving 14 triads (two {NS} and one {NNS} in each triad), participants engaged in collaborative discussions under two conditions: audio conferencing plus {ASR} transcripts with and without the highlighting function. {NS} showed various motivations to perform the extra task of highlighting. The highlighting efforts helped {NS} themselves focus on the discussion and enhanced their task performance while increasing the clarity and comfort perceived by {NNS} during communication. Having {NS} generating highlights can benefit both {NS} and {NNS}, but in different ways. We discuss the implications for research and design of multilingual collaborative work.},

To test our hypothesis, we conducted a lab experiment in which 14 groups of native and non-native speakers engaged in a story-telling task. Half of the groups received private transcripts that were available only to the {NNS}; the other half received publicly shared transcripts that were available to all group members. {NS} spoke more clearly, and both {NS} and {NNS} rated the quality of communication higher, when transcripts were publicly shared.

Design/methodology/approach – The authors explain the importance of the field and expose a dearth of prior research. Subsequently, they define the “language barrier” and elaborate on the causes underlying this barrier, drawing on social identity theory. Findings – The authors we propose an integrative model that consists of two coupled vicious cycles: the communications cycle – composed of the eight aspects of the language barrier – and the management cycle. Research limitations/implications – This contribution to an otherwise ignored field of business study should be considered only a first step in opening up a new research agenda. Specialists in each of the fields touched upon are invited to make a contribution to the debate. Practical implications – The management cycle suggests implications of the language barrier for various aspects of the {HQ}-subsidiary relationship: strategic decision-making, organization and personnel selection, global integration strategies, and autonomy and control procedures. Originality/value – This paper uses socio-linguistic theory to define and elaborate on the construct of the language barrier, a construct which is believed will be helpful in furthering research on the impact of language-difference on multinational management.},

Although all team members spoke English, different levels of fluency contributed to tensions on these teams. As nonnative English speakers attempted to counter the apprehension they felt when having to speak English and native English speakers fought against feeling excluded and devalued, a cycle of negative emotion ensued and disrupted interpersonal relationships on these teams. We describe in detail how emotions and actions evolved recursively as coworkers sought to relieve themselves of negative emotions prompted by the lingua franca mandate and inadvertently behaved in ways that triggered negative responses in distant coworkers. Our results add to the scant literature on the role of emotions in collaborative relationships in organizations and suggest that organizational policies can set in motion a cycle of negative emotions that interfere with collaborative work.},

Forty Chinese-Canadian dyads participated in the study which was carried out in Canada. Half of the dyads were randomly assigned to the experimental group and half to the control group. Males and females were evenly distributed in both experimental and control groups. Prior to their conversations, participants in the experimental group received a short training, whereas the control group did not receive any training. Major findings include: 1) in comparison with the untrained dyads, the trained dyads exhibited higher frequencies of successful interruptions, documenting the positive impact of training on intercultural face-to-face communication. The higher frequencies of unsuccessful interruptions displayed by the untrained dyads indicate a lack of congruity to the extent that they sometimes cannot successfully insert an interruption. 2) Chinese participants engaged in more cooperative interruptions than Canadians who displayed more intrusive interruptions, lending support for a major theory in Cross-Cultural psychology: Individualism-Collectivism. 3) The Canadians rated the Chinese as less relaxed than Chinese rated the Canadians, indicating that the second-language speakers have higher anxiety levels than native speakers in intercultural interactions, providing support for previous research and raising challenges for intercultural training.},

Most of the existing literature assumes that lower linguistic competence causes disempowerment, and that this relationship is largely static for individuals. This study, in contrast, finds that the sense of disempowerment caused by linguistic competence is negotiable as power dynamics between individuals can also be influenced by other relationships that act as potential sources of power. As a result, even for those with lower linguistic proficiency, perceived disempowerment can be reduced if other power-yielding factors compensate. An analysis of the narratives of 34 Japanese businesses demonstrates that such factors include value-of-information, goal sharing, and economic relationships. This article concludes by presenting a theoretical contribution to the conceptualization of the power of linguistic competence and the implications for educators.},

	abstract = {Machine translation ({MT}) creates both opportunities and challenges for multilingual collaboration: While {MT} enables collaborators to communicate via their native languages, it can introduce errors that make communication difficult. In the current paper, we examine whether displaying two alternative translations for each message will improve conversational grounding and task performance. We conducted a laboratory experiment in which monolingual native English speakers collaborated with bilingual native Mandarin speakers on a map navigation task. Each dyad performed the task in one of three communication conditions: {MT} with single output, {MT} with two outputs, and English as a common language. Dyads given two translations for each message communicated more efficiently, and performed better on the task, than dyads given one translation. Our findings show the value of providing multiple translations in multilingual collaboration, and suggest design features of future {MT}-based collaboration tools.},

	abstract = {We propose to improve real-time communication between people who do not share a common language by foregrounding potential problems in machine translation. We developed a prototype chat tool that displays two parallel translations of each chat turn, with the thought that comparing the translations might both highlight problems and provide resources for resolving them. We conducted a user study to investigate how people use and like such an interface compared to a standard one-translation interface. On balance, users preferred two translations to one, using them to both notice differences and infer meaning from uncertain translations, with no increase in workload. This suggests that this interface may help improve cross-lingual communication in practical applications and lays the groundwork for a larger design space around systems that highlight possible errors to support communication.},

The introduction briefly discusses the relationship of the sequential organization of talk and repairs with the notion of intersubjectivity. The first section of the paper presents the four turn-repair types proposed by Schegloff, Jefferson and Sacks. The second section emphasizes third turn position repair as delineated by Schegloff. The third section compares and contrasts similar and distinctive features of patterns of turn-taking and repair in the natural talk of two dyads of {NNSs} and two dyads of a {NS} and {NNS} conversation.},

While considerable research has been conducted on the various sources of foreign language anxiety at the beginning stages of language learning, relatively little is known about anxiety at more advanced levels. To fill this gap this small scale qualitative inquiry examines the construct of foreign language anxiety in the case of advanced-level language students: English majors. It aims to provide an insight into the nature and sources of L2-related anxiety from the advanced learner’s perspective: through the personal accounts of anxious learners themselves. The participants were students with high levels of foreign language anxiety, selected from a larger group of English majors based on their scores on the Hungarian version of the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale. They took part in a one-on-one in-depth interview concerning their learning and communication experience in {EFL}. The findings show that foreign language anxiety is not restricted to the early, beginning stages of language learning. Implications for teachers of foreign languages who teach advanced-level classes are discussed.},

Data for the online course were 10 archived asynchronous discussions on its threaded bulletin board. Data for the face-to-face course were verbatim transcripts of audio-taped recordings made during 10 of the 15 class sessions. Non-native speakers were more passive in the face-to-face classroom leaving the native speakers to assume leadership characteristics. In the online environments, non-native speakers and native speakers participated more equally in the discussion. Findings suggested that difficulties experienced by non-native speakers during impromptu face-to-face discussions may be alleviated given more opportunities and time for reflective articulation.},

Experiment 1 focused on the impact of agent model visual presence vs. voice alone for changing the women’s beliefs. Based on literature on human social models we hypothesized that the visual presence of the interface agent would result in more positive attitudes toward engineering and greater self-efﬁcacy than the presence of a human voice alone. Experiment 2 focused on the impact of model appearance-related characteristics for changing the women’s beliefs. Previous work with human social models suggests that people are more persuaded by models that are similar to them. Therefore, models that were young, female, and ‘‘cool” were predicted to be more effective in inﬂuencing young women’s attitudes. In accordance with our hypothesis, results revealed that participants who interacted with the visible agents reported signiﬁcantly greater utility for engineering, greater self-efﬁcacy, and greater interest in engineering-related ﬁelds than those who interacted with a human voice. In addition, the agent models that were similar to the young women tended to be the most effective for positively inﬂuencing the women’s stereotypes and self-efﬁcacy.},

In a laboratory and an online experiment, we scrutinized the effects of similarity with and idealness of an embodied agent feature on user involvement with, distance towards, and intentions to use the e-health advisor. The advisor’s body size was either similar or dissimilar to the user’s actual body size, and had an, according to the user, ideal (slender) or non-ideal (heavier) shape. Results indicated that the factor perceived idealness was more important than similarity for explaining involvement with, distance towards, and intentions to use the embodied agent, but in an unexpected way. Users regarded the heavier, non-ideal, e-health advisors as more trustworthy, which explained the larger part of the variance in the level of involvement, distance, and intentions to use a health advisor. Sometimes, it seems better to forget the stereotypical preference and design embodied agents that are not ideal.},

Language is one of the most salient identifiers of individuals and groups as well as an integral aspect of self-concept. Managers of multilingual teams and {MNCs}, where speakers of different first languages must rely on mutual interactions to achieve common goals, are likely to deal with communication challenges among many other managerial concerns. Adopting a corporate common language ({CCL}) provides {MNCs} benefits, such as efficiency and coherence, from standardizing employees’ use of language. Yet, the fact that a certain language is viewed as “standard” or common—and others as “nonstandard” and uncommon—can potentially create tensions between native and nonnative speakers of it. To increase scholarly attention to this topic, we discuss topics related to language attitudes that can affect communication processes in multilingual {MNCs}. The implications of, and organizational benefits for, sensitizing managers of {MNCs} that have adopted a {CCL} approach to these intergroup dynamics are discussed. We conclude the article with future research agenda for cross-cultural management researchers facing the global environment in which organizational, cultural, and sectoral boundaries are increasingly blurred and multilingualism impacts both internal and external functions of organizations.},

But, while models exist to control the display and interactive dynamics of emotional expressions, such as smiles, in embodied agents, these techniques can not be applied to video interactions between humans. In this work, we propose an audiovisual smile transformation algorithm able to manipulate an incoming video stream in real-time to parametrically control the amount of smile seen on the user’s face and heard in their voice, while preserving other characteristics such as the user’s identity or the timing and content of the interaction. The transformation is composed of separate audio and visual pipelines, both based on a warping technique informed by real-time detection of audio and visual landmarks. Taken together, these two parts constitute a unique audiovisual algorithm which, in addition to providing simultaneous real-time transformations of a real person’s face and voice, allows to investigate the integration of both modalities of smiles in real-world social interactions.},

We present a naïve prototype, the “Mimicry Injector”, that injects artificial mimicry in real-time virtual interactions. In an evaluation study, two participants were embodied in a Virtual Reality ({VR}) simulation, and had to perform a negotiation task. Their virtual characters either a) replicated only the original behavior or b) displayed the original behavior plus induced mimicry. We found that most participants did not detect the modification.

Speciﬁcally, these studies target untested possible short-term outcomes from social interactions involving shared laughter: positive emotions, negative emotions, and perceived similarity. In turn, each are tested as possible mechanisms through which shared laughter promotes more global relationship well-being (i.e., how). A series of online and laboratory studies provide correlational and causal support for the hypothesis that shared laughter promotes relationship well-being, with increased perceptions of similarity most consistently driving this effect. Discussion focuses on the importance of considering the behavior of laughter itself, as situated within the social context, when making predictions about laughter’s relevance for social life.},

In an effort to determine whether these parochial effects can be isolated to ingroup favoritism as opposed to outgroup derogation, Experiment 2 paired a joke-teller described as politically active (either from the right or the left) with one who was described as politically neutral. These more subtle comparisons suggest that the parochial effects observed in our joke understanding paradigm are mediated, at least in part, by the presence of an outgroup member.},

	title = {{THE} {HUMANIZING} {POWER} {OF} {SHARED} {HUMOR}: {APPLICATIONS} {TO} {CONFLICT} {AND} {STIGMA} {REDUCTION}},
	abstract = {Drawing on Henri Bergson’s insight that humor is
unique to human beings, I argue that the presence of humor
in others signals their humanness. Humor conveys
information about who is like us, and acts to affiliate
those who share our humor, and to distance those who are
seen to lack a sense of humor. Thus, humor serves important
social functions, and humor experienced psychologically
with others (i.e. shared humor) has different consequences
than humor experienced alone. In Chapter 1, I examine the
effects of shared humor on interpersonal and intergroup
conflict using a combination of web-based surveys, lab
studies, and mobile technology-based experiments in the
real world, in a variety of national and international
contexts. Across 8 studies, I demonstrate that (a)
participants ascribe a fuller capacity for humor to ingroup
members compared to outgroup members across political,
racial, and national divides, and (b) providing
participants with evidence of shared humor with adversarial
others reduces perceptions of conflict, attributions of
bias, support for militarism, while increasing relationship
satisfaction, trust, support for cooperation, and
prosociality. In Chapter 2, I examine the humanizing
effects of shared humor in two domains of stigma. Using
vignette methodology, I demonstrate that perceiving a
mentally ill person as having the capacity to share humor
reduces the stigma of mental illness and increases empathy
toward him. Using real-world charitable donations, I
demonstrate that humor shared between participants and
homeless people increases generosity above and beyond
validated appeals for charity.
The studies in this dissertation illustrate the impact
of humor in the domains of conflict and stigma.
Participants saw a sense of humor as a characteristic more
typical of themselves and of people like them than of non-
human beings and of stigmatized and conflictual outgroup
members, suggesting that a relative absence of a fully
human capacity for humor is dehumanizing. Conversely, we
found that seeing evidence of, or sharing, humor reduced
the divides of stigma and interpersonal and intergroup
conflict. Taken together, the results demonstrate that
evidence of humor in adversarial and stigmatized others
serves to strongly signal their humanity and thus promote
attitudes and behaviors commonly afforded to those we
consider to be fully human.},

However, as cognitive linguists have discerned for many other aspects of language, much of the ways that people speak and understand one another is motivated by people’s pervasive bodily experiences. Ironic humor provides another compelling phenomenon in which to understand the embodied foundation of both linguistic meaning and multimodal expression, particularly in terms of rough-and-tumble play. Many forms of humor arise from different benign violations of the body in play fighting. We describe cognitive linguistic and psychological evidence on the importance of bodily experience, and benign violations of the body, in linguistic expressions referring to teasing and humor. Variations of rough-and-tumble play help explain some of the instabilities in the ways ironic humor unfolds in interpersonal interactions.},

This article examines the use of humor—an extremely effective technique of persuasive communication—as one potential route whose potency in resolving intractable conflicts has thus far been neglected. In Study 1, Palestinians who read a message from an “Israeli representative” (conveying the Israeli narrative of the conflict) agreed more with the Israeli perspective once three short humorous asides were added to the original statement. When these humorous asides targeted Jewish-Israelis, Palestinian-Israeli participants were more willing to compromise on various aspects of the conflict. In Study 2, Jewish-Israelis who read a message from a “Palestinian representative” were more agreeable to the Palestinian message (portraying the Palestinian narrative) once three short humorous asides were added to the original statement. When these humorous asides were general in nature (but not when they targeted Palestinian-Israelis), Jewish-Israeli participants were more willing to compromise on various aspects of this intractable conflict. These findings further demonstrate the power of psychological barriers in intractable conflicts and the potential of humor to overcome them. Implications and limitations of the current research are discussed.},

Previous research has shown the importance of mimicry in human- human interaction, highlighting its relation with the level of engagement between interactants. In the present work we are interested in mimicry appearing in human-agent interac- tions. Through an experimental setting, we analyze humans’ reactions to agent’s mimicry, in particular in relation with smiles. Twelve subjects tell a story to an agent that either mimics the user’s smiles, smiles randomly or does not smile at all. Results show that the agent’s behavior influences the user’s. Users smile more and longer when the agent performs smiling behavior. Moreover in both smiling conditions the agent is rated more positively than in the condition when it never smiles. However, no significant results have been found between the two smiling conditions.},

Simultaneously, too high an abstraction level may change participants’ attitudes in relation to the core learning goals. This quantitative study examined the relationship between level of environment abstraction, within a virtual space, and feelings of presence for business negotiation role playing. Negotiation values were also measured, in relation to environment abstraction. Two levels of virtual space abstraction were implemented, through the open source software Open Wonderland, where class lectures and student driven negotiation role playing took place over a semester. Results indicated a high abstract environment reduced feelings of presence compared to a low abstract environment, even when the low abstract level was not realistic but rather employing a metaphor related to instructional goals. The values students used in negotiation across the two abstraction levels exhibited no difference, indicating the fundamental approach to negotiating was not related to the virtual environment design.},

            Driven by large industry investments, developments of Virtual Reality ({VR}) technologies including unobtrusive sensors, actuators and novel display devices are rapidly progressing. Realism and interactivity have been postulated as crucial aspects of immersive {VR} since the naissance of the concept. However, today’s {VR} still falls short from creating real life-like experiences in many regards. This holds particularly true when introducing the “social dimension” into the virtual worlds. Apparently, creating convincing virtual selves and virtual others and conveying meaningful and appropriate social behavior still is an open challenge for future {VR}. This challenge implies both, technical aspects, such as the real-time capacities of the systems, but also psychological aspects, such as the dynamics of human communication. Our knowledge of {VR} systems is still fragmented with regard to social cognition, although the social dimension is crucial when aiming at autonomous agents with a certain social background intelligence. It can be questioned though whether a perfect copy of real life interactions is a realistic or even meaningful goal of social {VR} development at this stage. Taking into consideration the specific strengths and weaknesses of humans and machines, we propose a conceptual turn in social {VR} which focuses on what we call “hybrid avatar-agent systems”. Such systems are required to generate i) avatar mediated interactions between real humans, taking advantage of their social intuitions and flexible communicative skills and ii) an artificial social intelligence ({AIS}) which monitors, and potentially moderates or transforms ongoing virtual interactions based on social signals, such as performing adaptive manipulations of behavior in intercultural conversations. The current article sketches a respective base architecture and discusses necessary research prospects and challenges as a starting point for future research and development.},

	abstract = {Psychological theories of emotion have often defined an emotion as simultaneous changes in several mental and bodily components. In addition, appraisal theories assume that an appraisal component elicits changes in the other emotion components (e.g., motivational, behavioural, experiential). Neither the componential definition of emotion nor appraisal theory have been systematically translated to paradigms for emotion induction, many of which rely on passive emotion induction without a clear theoretical framework. As a result, the observed emotions are often weak. This study explored the potential of virtual reality ({VR}) to evoke strong emotions in ecologically valid scenarios that fully engaged the mental and bodily components of the participant. Participants played several {VR} games and reported on their emotions. Multivariate analyses using hierarchical clustering and multilevel linear modelling showed that participants experienced intense, multi-componential emotions in {VR}. We identified joy and fear clusters of responses, each involving changes in appraisal, motivation, physiology, feeling, and regulation. Appraisal variables were found to be the most predictive for fear and joy intensities, compared to other emotion components, and were found to explain individual differences in {VR} scenarios, as predicted by appraisal theory. The results advocate upgraded methodologies for the induction and analysis of emotion processes.},

Data from 29 articles were cross-analyzed in terms of research topics, technologies used, language learning settings, sample groups, and methodological approaches. It was found that the three most popular research topics for learners were interactive communication; behaviors, affections, and beliefs; and task-based instruction. However, the analysis results highlight the need for the inclusion of the impact of teacher. The data also revealed that more studies are utilizing triangulation of measurement processes to enable in-depth analysis. A trend of gathering data through informal learning procedures was also observed.

	abstract = {Cultural differences exist in the use of emotion regulation ({ER}) strategies, but the focus to date has been on intrapersonal {ER} strategies such as cognitive reappraisal. An emerging literature highlights the importance of interpersonal {ER}, which utilizes social cues to facilitate the regulation of emotional states. In cultures that place high value on social interconnectedness as integral to their collectivistic self-construal, including East Asian cultures, interpersonal {ER} strategies may be particularly effective in reducing negative affect but this has not been previously tested. In this study, two groups comprising East Asian (n = 48) and Western European (n = 38) participants were randomly assigned to receive a priming narration depicting the use of either interpersonal (e.g., social modeling, perspective taking) or intrapersonal (e.g., cognitive reappraisal) {ER} strategies during a stressful experience. They were then instructed to utilize similar {ER} strategies in an emotion reactivity task during which they viewed high arousing negative pictorial stimuli while their heart rate ({HR}), heart rate variability (high frequency power – {HF}-{HRV}) and subjective affective states were measured. First we found that the East Asian group reported higher use of interpersonal {ER} strategies of social modeling and perspective taking in daily life. During the experimental interpersonal prime exposure, the East Asian group showed elevated {HF}-{HRV} (relative to baseline) compared to the Western European group, indicating more adaptive {ER}, but this pattern was not sustained during the reactivity or recovery phases. Instead, the East Asian group demonstrated increased {HF}-{HRV} and decreased {HR} across both prime conditions. The East Asian group also showed greater decreases in positive affect across the course of the experiment. Furthermore, individual differences in social modeling and individualistic self-construal moderated the effect of the {ER} prime in the East Asian group at trend levels, and main effects for perspective taking and reappraisal were observed in the Western European group. The ﬁndings support the notion that engaging in interpersonal {ER} strategies may be more beneﬁcial for East Asian groups when immediately exposed to a stressful situation, as these strategies are congruent with cultural context and preferences, but our priming methodology may have limited the longer-term beneﬁts.},

Affective Ground is achieved when interactants have reached shared understanding about how behavior should be interpreted emotionally. The paper contributes a review and critique of current perspectives on emotion in {HRI}. Further it outlines how research on emotion in {HRI} can benefit from taking an affective grounding perspective and outlines implications for the design of robots capable of participating in the coordination on affect in interaction.},

In a controlled experiment, we examined the role of backchanneling and task complexity on team functioning and perceptions of the robots’ engagement and competence. Based on results from 73 participants interacting with autonomous humanoid robots as part of a human-robot team (one participant, one confederate, and three robots), we found that when robots used backchanneling team functioning improved and the robots were seen as more engaged. Ironically, the robots using backchanneling were perceived as less competent than those that did not. Our results suggest that backchanneling plays an important role in human-robot teams and that the design and implementation of robots for human-robot teams may be more effective if backchanneling capability is provided.},

Specifically, the robot either intervened by repairing a task-directed or personal attack by a confederate or did not intervene. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the robot’s repair interventions increased the groups’ awareness of conflict after the occurrence of a personal attack thereby acting against the groups’ tendency to suppress the conflict. These findings suggest that repair heightened awareness of a normative violation. Overall, our results provide support for the idea that robots can aid team functioning by regulating core team processes such as conflict.},

Although several strategies and technological approaches have been proposed for emotion regulation, they often require conscious attention and effort. This often limits their efﬁcacy in practice. In this paper, we propose a different approach inspired by self-perception theory: noticing that people are often reacting to the perception of their own behavior, we artiﬁcially change their perceptions to inﬂuence their emotions. We conducted two studies to evaluate the potential of this approach by automatically and subtly altering how people perceive their own voice. In one study, participants that received voice feedback with a calmer tone during relationship conﬂicts felt less anxious. In the other study, participants who listened to their own voices with a lower pitch during contentious debates felt more powerful. We discuss the implications of our ﬁndings and the opportunities for designing automatic and less perceptible emotion regulation systems.},

We argue that this assumption has potentially negative implications, as increasing social capabilities in robots can produce an expectations gap where humans develop unrealistically high expectations of social robots due to generalization from human mental models. By conducting two studies with 674 participants, we examine how people develop and adjust mental models of robots. We ﬁnd that both a robot’s physical appearance and its behavior inﬂuence how we form these models. This suggests it is possible for a robot to unintentionally manipulate a human into building an inaccurate mental model of its overall abilities simply by displaying a few capabilities that humans possess, such as speaking and turn-taking. We conclude that this expectations gap, if not corrected for, could ironically result in less effective collaborations as robot capabilities improve.},

Participants (N=441) shared a recent stressful experience with one of three agent interfaces: 1) a non-interactive, non-personified survey, 2) an interactive, non-personified chatbot, and 3) an interactive, personified chatbot. We coded these responses to examine how agent type influenced the nature of the stressor disclosed, and the intimacy and amount of disclosure. Participants discussed fewer homelife related stressors, but more finance-related stressors and more chronic stressors overall with the personified chatbot than the other two agents. The personified chatbot was also twice as likely as the other agents to receive disclosures that contained very little detail. We discuss the role played by personification and interactivity in interactions with conversational agents, and implications for design.},

	abstract = {Contemporary emotion regulation research emphasizes intrapersonal processes such as cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, but people experiencing affect commonly choose not to go it alone. Instead, individuals often turn to others for help in shaping their affective lives. How and under what circumstances does such interpersonal regulation modulate emotional experience? Although scientists have examined allied phenomena such as social sharing, empathy, social support, and prosocial behavior for decades, there have been surprisingly few attempts to integrate these data into a single conceptual framework of interpersonal regulation. Here we propose such a framework. We first map a “space” differentiating classes of interpersonal regulation according to whether an individual uses an interpersonal regulatory episode to alter their own or another person’s emotion. We then identify 2 types of processes—response-dependent and response-independent—that could support interpersonal regulation. This framework classifies an array of processes through which interpersonal contact fulfills regulatory goals. More broadly, it organizes diffuse, heretofore independent data on “pieces” of interpersonal regulation, and identifies growth points for this young and exciting research domain.},

I also examine post-recording playback interviews in which speakers acknowledge and comment on the problematic source texts and their performances. I illustrate how speakers construct their individual humorous identities and their shared cultural and ethnic identities through the “others” they voice, while simultaneously activating and reinforcing the social stereotypes represented in the media they reference. While these speakers do not immediately critique these stereotypes, in playback interviews they resist the identities formerly performed, with their statements ranging from ambiguous evaluation to deconstruction of the media and the references. This study contributes to understanding how and why speakers invoke media-embedded linguistic and cultural stereotypes for humorous individual and group identity construction, and how humorous media references serve as a site for activating, reinforcing, and deconstructing media stereotypes about linguistic and cultural identities in everyday interaction.},

Computer-mediated communication and the virtual nature of collaboration tend to exacerbate such communication issues into problems of conversation dominance, misattribution, and group conflict. New communication tools have the potential to mitigate some of these problems by augmenting individuals’ and team’s awareness of their communication inputs and processes. We explore how such feedback affects the communication content, attention distribution, and affective states of Chinese and American collaborators engaged in a creative design task. We describe our tool, present preliminary findings from an ongoing lab experiment, and discuss next steps in our research regarding ways of detecting the impact of real-time conversation feedback in intercultural collaboration environments.},

All analyses were controlled for generalized affect toward the team to reduce threats to validity of common method bias and affect. The results suggest the value of fusion teamwork for generating creativity in multicultural teams and the importance of having members of multicultural teams who have high versus low levels of cultural metacognition.},

Our findings suggest that for learning basic intercultural communicative skills, a 3-dimensional (3-D) interface with animation and sound produced equivalent learning to a more static 2-D interface. However, learners took significantly longer to analyze and respond to the actions of animated virtual humans, suggesting a deeper engagement. We found large gains in learning across conditions. There was no differential effect with the tutor engaged, but it was found to have a positive impact on learner success in a transfer task.

Although numerous research studies acknowledged the affordance, a fullscale investigation that discussed how they can be applied to language learning with substantial evidence of effect sizes were not presented. Thus, this analysis aimed to synthesize the research findings particularly in the impact of 3DVWs on language learning by addressing two issues. The first one concerned the role of interaction in 3DVWs with theoretical bases, while the second issue concerned the effect sizes of moderating variables, based on experimental findings that were published between 2008 and 2019. Data with 50 variables generated from 13 primary studies were analyzed. Different patterns of interaction were identified based on three theories. The meta-analysis showed (1) significant overall linguistic gains (d ¼ .832) and affective gains (d ¼ .531), and (2) various effect sizes for moderator variables, such as types of learning activities. Based on these results, this paper used the notion of partnership to interpret the relation between 3DVWs and language learners.},

Undergraduate students enrolled in beginner Italian courses viewed three ordinary Italian environments with the use of their smartphones, headphones, and Google Cardboard. Through surveys, written reflections, and a focus group interview participants shared their cultural understandings and attitudes toward virtual reality. Results show that virtual reality was positively perceived and helped learners discover new cultural layers generally not encountered in traditional pedagogical materials.},

Computer-mediated communication ({CMC}) can be used to assist in increasing access to native speakers and opportunities to listen. This study investigates the effectiveness of the use of Second Life and Skype as part of facilitation techniques and the affordances of these online tools for developing listening comprehension. Participants in the study were learning either English or Croatian and were located in Sydney and Brisbane in Australia, Split in Croatia, and Mostar in Bosnia and Hercegovina. A mixed-methods approach was utilised incorporating pretests and post-tests (quantitative data) to gain information on the effectiveness of the techniques for developing listening comprehension and in-depth interviews (qualitative data) to gain the participants’ views on the perceived effectiveness of the techniques and the affordances of Second Life or Skype. The results of the study indicate that both techniques resulted in positive gains in the development of listening comprehension. Based on the analysis of the interview data, a more in-depth perspective on the affordances of each online tool was developed, which informed the creation of a new facilitation technique utilising both tools. The study demonstrates how online tools can be used to facilitate interaction between learners and illustrates the need for the selection of online tools for language learning to be based on pedagogy. It is recommended that the selection of tools should be carefully considered in alignment with task aims and the affordances of online tools.},

	title = {Supporting Social Learning and Cultural Awareness in a 3D Virtual World for Military Training An Empirical Study},
	abstract = {This thesis is based on a research project conducted by the Norwegian Armed Forces named {CAMO} (Cultural Awareness in Military Operations). It is an investigation into how a virtual world can be used to support training in cross-cultural communication and cultural awareness for soldiers who are to be deployed to take part in international military operations. The informants were cadets in training to become officers, stationed at The Norwegian Military Academy. The data for the thesis was collected in a one-day experiment. Second Life, a multi user virtual environment ({MUVE}), was used as a platform in order to conduct a scenario- based role-play simulation related to cross-cultural challenges. The scenario was structured based on a set of mini-scenarios with accompanying learning goals, containing a selection of critical instances and situations that the soldiers could encounter during a deployment to Afghanistan and therefore should know how to handle. An Afghan village and virtual avatars were modeled in Second Life, and used to stage the role-play.
I have created the following research questions:
1. How can Second Life support social learning?
2. How can Second Life support cross-cultural communication and cultural awareness in
military training?
The thesis is structured as a qualitative case study, in which we used a mixed-methods approach to data collection and analysis. Data collection methods were questionnaire, interview and observation. They were chosen to be appropriate in order to investigate how the soldiers learned about cross-cultural communication in a social context and how they evaluated the use of Second Life as a platform for teaching and learning about cross-cultural communication and cultural awareness. The interviews and observations were analyzed partially by using a grounded theory approach during data categorization. A combination of social learning theories was used to create an initial set of categories for the analysis that was later refined in a bottom up iterative process of data categorization. I have triangulated the questionnaire data with the interaction material and the interviews in order to evaluate these sources in relation to one another.
{III}
We have found that Second Life supports aspects of interaction and learning in a social context by employing techniques such as perspective taking, reflexive practice and establishing common ground in communication. We also found that Second Life works well as platform for training in cross-cultural communication and cultural awareness by role-play scenarios where virtual representations of cultural artifacts are modeled and incorporate in the scenarios. However, we did come across some constraints that hindered the flow of communication. Finally, at the end, I present some suggestions for improvement to address the constraints.},

These online environments could potentially be unique research platforms for the social sciences and clinical therapy, but it is crucial to first establish that social behavior and norms in virtual environments are comparable to those in the physical world. In an observational study of Second Life, a virtual community, we collected data from avatars in order to explore whether social norms of gender, interpersonal distance ({IPD}), and eye gaze transfer into virtual environments even though the modality of movement is entirely different (i.e., via keyboard and mouse as opposed to eyes and legs). Our results showed that established findings of {IPD} and eye gaze transfer into virtual environments: (1) male-male dyads have larger {IPDs} than female-female dyads, (2) male-male dyads maintain less eye contact than female-female dyads, and (3) decreases in {IPD} are compensated with gaze avoidance as predicted by the Equilibrium Theory. We discuss implications for users of online games as well as for social scientists who seek to conduct research in virtual environments.},

Virtual Environments ({VEs}), are three dimensional virtual worlds that combine sound, text, and gestures in computer-mediated communication ({CMC}) processes. In {VEs}, communication can be done through text-based {CMC} such as instant messaging and chat, but also through additional gestural, visual, proxemic and deictic non-verbal channels. For this reason, {VEs} require an understanding of the impact of gestures in various contexts. This paper will outline common {CMC} medium affordances as related to {VEs} and discuss the importance of using gestures in various online communication contexts. In doing so, this paper will explore the issues that may influence the design and use of gestures for specific professional communication purposes. Because gestures may serve in addressing intercultural contexts and have informational and cognitive communicative benefits within virtual environments, this paper will end with an exploration of specific gesture designs that may help facilitate their use by professional communicators.},

Virtual teams face a number of challenges, discussed in the literature in terms of communication through technology, difﬁculty in building trust, conveying social cues, and creating awareness, as well as cultural differences. These challenges impact collaboration, but also learning and innovation. This research focuses on how a social medium, the 3D virtual environment, is perceived to enable learning and innovation in virtual teams. We study this through a qualitative study based on interviews of distributed work managers’ perception of {VEs}. The major ﬁndings are that {VEs} are perceived to create collaborative learning atmospheres for virtual teams in terms of enabling engagement, a shared context awareness, and support in social network building. Another ﬁnding is that {VEs} are perceived to enable team learning, knowledge development, and collaboration through persistence of content, information sharing, learning through role-plays and simulations, and visualization. Furthermore, {VEs} enable the development of co-created content as well as new ways of working in virtual teams. Ó 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We conducted a user study to compare real human perceptions of a virtual human ({VH}) with their expectancy of the {VH}’s gaze behavior. Each participant experienced and evaluated two conditions: (i) {VH} with mutual gaze only and (ii) {VH} with mutual and joint gaze. We found evidence of positive responses when the {VH} exhibited joint gaze, and preliminary evidence supporting the effect of expectancy violation, i.e., more positive perceptions when participants were presented with {VH}’s gaze capabilities that exceeded what was expected.},

Participants interacted with a virtual agent in an immersive virtual environment or nonimmersive virtual environment under three different levels of real-world distractions (i.e., no distraction, passively being exposed to the sound of a ringing cell phone, and actively responding to ringing cell phone). Increased immersion had a positive effect on telepresence, but a negative effect on recognition and recall; immersion did not have a signiﬁcant effect on social presence. Real-world distractions had a negative effect on recognition, recall, and social presence, but did not affect telepresence or affective valence. Participants who were actively distracted performed more poorly on the recall measure and reported lower levels of social presence than their passively distracted counterparts. These ﬁndings suggest that (a) increased immersion will not uniformly improve social virtual reality experiences and (b) more research is needed on whether and how real-world events should be integrated into virtual environments.},

This research investigated if sexist nonverbal behavior of a male instructor could activate stereotype threat among women in a virtual classroom. In addition, the research examined if learners’ avatar representation in virtual reality altered this nonverbal process. Speciﬁcally, a 2 (avatar gender: female vs. male) · 2 (instructor behavior: dominant sexist vs. nondominant or nonsexist) between-subjects experiment was used. Data from 76 female college students demonstrated that participants learned less and performed worse when interacting with a sexist male instructor compared with a nonsexist instructor in a virtual classroom. Participants learned and performed equally well when represented by female and male avatars. Our ﬁndings extend previous research in physical learning settings, suggesting that dominant-sexist behaviors may give rise to stereotype threat and undermine women’s learning outcomes in virtual classrooms.

	abstract = {The traditional language laboratory consists of computer-based exercises in which students practice the language individually, working on language form drills and listening comprehension activities. In addition to the traditional approach to the laboratory requirement, students in the study participated in a weekly conversation hour focusing on improving oral proficiency.
The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to determine the effect of two different types of conversation hours, face-to-face and virtual, on the oral proficiency levels of students enrolled in intermediate Spanish classes at the college level. Oral proficiency was measured using the Simulated Oral Proficiency Interview ({SOPI}), before and after treatment. The face-to-face conversation hours took place at the language laboratory in a classroom and the virtual conversation hours took place in the online multi-user virtual environment known as Second Life. The research question was: What is the effect of attending virtual conversation hours or face-to-face conversation hours on students’ oral proficiency?
The statistical data analysis was conducted using the conversation hours as the independent variable (face-to-face or virtual), the {SOPI} posttest scores as the dependent variable, and the {SOPI} pretest scores as the covariate. A total sample of 52 students was involved.
i
Posttest data were collected following 14 weeks of treatment during which students in each group attended the weekly conversation hours. Data analysis showed there was significant difference in oral proficiency gain between the face-to-face group and the virtual group. The results of the {ANCOVA} test allowed the rejection of the null hypothesis, as there was a significant difference in effect on the adjusted {SOPI} posttest scores of the participants in the virtual conversation group versus those in the face-to-face conversation group. The virtual group improved their oral proficiency significantly better than the face-to-face group. In addition, the {SOPI} scores of both groups increased significantly. The {SOPI} posttest scores were significantly higher than the {SOPI} pretest scores for both groups. Therefore, both face-to-face and virtual conversation hours could yield a supplemental method to the traditional approach of the language laboratory to improve communicative competence.},

In this study we aim at comparing the dynamics and content of group discussions in desktop virtual environments with physical-world discussions. We have conducted an experiment in which four groups of 7–12 participants each carried out a political discussion on the same topic; speciﬁcally, global warming. Two groups conducted the experiment in a face-to-face setting and two other groups conducted a similar discussion inside the virtual world {SecondLife} (http://www.secondlife.com). Virtual-world discussions were found to include shorter sentences on average, have a smaller number of themes discussed, discuss a smaller number of themes in depth, and require a longer time for discussion threads to form. In this paper we provide a quantitative analysis of the similarities and differences between virtual-world and physical-world discussions.},

In particular, possible selves theory was used to discover whether learners realised a variety of selves. Studies of avatar subjectivity have focused on appearance and bricolage as vehicles for virtual subjectivity. Motivation theory articulates relations between various selves including the here-and-now self and desired selves which may function as self-guides, if a learning task is seen as realistic. In all, 40 student blogs were analysed using computational methods. This study found support for both approaches. Six frequently-occurring positive, and three frequently-occurring negative connections between self and ability are explored through examples. Conclusions are that virtual subjectivity is more goal-oriented and less involved with appearance and game-play in older users, older users accept social limitations on self, and second-language learners’ metacritical awareness may impact their ability to understand language tasks as realistic.},

As we enter the twenty-ﬁrst century, immersive virtual environment technology promises new experimental venues in which researchers can study proxemics. Immersive virtual environments provide realistic and compelling experimental settings without sacriﬁcing experimental control. The experiment reported here tested Argyle and Dean’s (1965) equilibrium theory’s speciﬁcation of an inverse relationship between mutual gaze, a nonverbal cue signaling intimacy, and interpersonal distance. Participants were immersed in a three-dimensional virtual room in which a virtual human representation (that is, an embodied agent) stood. Under the guise of a memory task, participants walked towards and around the agent. Distance between the participant and agent was tracked automatically via our immersive virtual environment system. All participants maintained more space around agents than they did around similarly sized and shaped but nonhuman-like objects. Female participants maintained more interpersonal distance between themselves and agents who engaged them in eye contact (that is, mutual gaze behavior) than between themselves and agents who did not engage them in eye contact, whereas male participants did not. Implications are discussed for the study of proxemics via immersive virtual environment technology, as well as the design of virtual environments and virtual humans.},

They were involved in four tandem oral interaction activities in the {VW} Second Life with a group of native Spanish students from the Universidad de Cádiz (Spain). A mixed-methods research design with quantitative and qualitative data was applied. Data were collected about the participants’ foreign language anxiety ({FLA}) levels, self-efﬁcacy beliefs, and psychological proﬁle (introvert/extrovert). Participants were also asked to answer three open-ended questions about how they felt during the interaction in the {VW}. The results obtained reveal a strong relationship between self-efﬁcacy beliefs and the anonymity effect experienced by students, although no correlation was found between the participants’ {FLA} levels or personality proﬁles and their experience of the anonymity afforded by the {VW}.},

The data gathered was compared to that of a group of students who completed similar oral interaction activities in the traditional classroom ({CR} Group).

The anonymity afforded by the {VW} had a positive effect on some of the students, who reported increased self-conﬁdence and decreased nervousness.

	abstract = {Avatars are growing in popularity and present in many interfaces used for computer-mediated communication ({CMC}) including social media, e-commerce, and education. Communication researchers have been investigating avatars for over twenty years, and an examination of this literature reveals similarities but also notable discrepancies in conceptual definitions. The goal of this review is to provide a general overview of current debates, methodological approaches, and trends in findings. Our review synthesizes previous research in four areas. First, we examine how scholars have conceptualized the term “avatar,” identify similarities and differences across these definitions, and recommend that scholars use the term consistently. Next, we review theoretical perspectives relevant to avatar perception (e.g., the computers as social actors framework). Then, we examine avatar characteristics that communicators use to discern the humanity and social potential of an avatar (anthropomorphism, form realism, behavioral realism, and perceived agency) and discuss implications for attributions and communication outcomes. We also review findings on the social categorization of avatars, such as when people apply categories like sex, gender, race, and ethnicity to their evaluations of digital representations. Finally, we examine research on avatar selection and design relevant to communication outcomes. Here, we review both motivations in {CMC} contexts (such as self-presentation and identity expression) and potential effects (e.g., persuasion). We conclude with a discussion of future directions for avatar research and propose that communication researchers consider avatars not just as a topic of study, but also as a tool for testing theories and understanding critical elements of human communication. Avatarmediated environments provide researchers with a number of advantageous technological affordances that can enable manipulations that may be difficult or inadvisable to execute in natural environments. We conclude by discussing the use of avatar research to extend communication theory and our understanding of communication processes.},

Two proposed constructs, virtual-physioception and virtual intersubjective presencing formed the basis of an online survey exploring group, avatar, and individual experiences. Measures were adapted from Andrew Stricker of The Air University (United States Air Force) and the {US} National Cancer Institute’s Team Science Toolkit. The constructs were framed around an inferred discipline of presencing built upon research performed by Peter Senge and Otto Scharmer of {MIT}. Correlations were found between avatar embodiment and interdisciplinary professional/personal development practices suggesting the collaborative potential of {CVEs} to support both constructs. Resultant qualitative themes included levels of avatar embodiment culminating in a state of transdisciplinarity based upon self-leadership practices. Heuristics for collaboration using embodied avatars were created based on findings of mixed, quantitative and qualitative analysis and literature review. Future research is proposed into virtual learning organization communities as blended, virtual-physical lifestyles reliant upon strengths- based practices. Future collaborative research was recommended connecting {CVE} use with simulators and experimentation with open virtual conferences as platforms for community engagement in support of collective intelligence for mass collaboration and crowdsourced, citizen science.},

In {VEs}, communication can be done through text-based {CMC} such as instant messaging and chat, but also through additional gestural, visual, proxemic and deictic non-verbal channels. For this reason, {VEs} require an understanding of the impact of gestures in various contexts. This paper will outline common {CMC} medium affordances as related to {VEs} and discuss the importance of using gestures in various online communication contexts. In doing so, this paper will explore the issues that may influence the design and use of gestures for specific professional communication purposes. Because gestures may serve in addressing intercultural contexts and have informational and cognitive communicative benefits within virtual environments, this paper will end with an exploration of specific gesture designs that may help facilitate their use by professional communicators.},

Ancient rhetorician Cicero coined the term “chironomia” for non-verbal communication elements that were used in a persuasive manner. Non-verbal communication is an inherently human trait and, while virtual worlds provide an immersive space for interaction, they also introduce new questions regarding standards and best communication practices within them. Because virtual worlds present a richer environment with multiple semiotic modes of interaction, they add additional channels for communication over previous textbased online modalities. In such worlds, users can select and execute non-verbal behavior in a rhetorical manner by animating their avatar thus performing in a virtual context. Therefore, communication in virtual worlds presents an intentional “speech act” in which a speaker purposefully seeks to evoke a particular response or transmit specific semantic content. As people's behavior in virtual worlds evolves and codifies, virtual worlds as a communication platform will need to develop standards based on successful user practices. In this paper we propose the need for a virtual chironomia – a standard for non-verbal elements in virtual world.},

In order to explain the shift in degree of anthropomorphism, we discuss Goffman’s theory of symbolic interactionism, which holds that the self is constructed as a persona through social performance and relates identity to social behavior rather than appearance. Since nonanthropomorphic avatars are persistent characters engaged in a prolonged performance in virtual worlds, their use also may motivate emerging social mores, politics and ideologies. This paper argues that such avatar species create new social interactions and modes of communication that may signal interesting directions for future research.},

The goals of this study are: 1) to investigate cultural differences in avatar expression evaluation and apply findings from Psychological study in human facial expression recognition, 2) to identify design features that cause cultural differences in avatar facial expression interpretation. The results confirmed that 1) there are cultural differences in interpreting avatars’ facial expressions among Asian countries, and the psychological theory that suggests physical proximity affects facial expression recognition accuracy is also applicable to avatar facial expressions, 2) use of gestures and gesture marks may sometimes cause counter-effects in recognizing avatar facial expressions.},

When examining the methodological and theoretical choices of these studies, four trends could be identified that characterize group studies on {VEs}: (a) testing the applicability of real-life, social behavior norms in {VEs}, (b) a lack of work group studies using {VEs}, (c) the micro-level treatment of social and groups, and (d) a lack of covering theory.

In particular, systems used in several recent experiments provided information about others’ current activities so that their availability for conversation could be assessed, and interruptions could be timed strategically. One issue with these experimental systems, though, is that many do not notify the observed party that these observations are taking place. There is reason to believe that such notification could be valuable to users, and that it could alter observers’ behavior. Moreover, factors such as the perceived urgency of the interruption could affect willingness to violate social norms in gathering information. We report on an experiment assessing the impact of perceived visibility and task urgency on awareness checking behavior. Results suggest that people check more often when they believe their partners do not know they are checking, and more often when the task is time-constrained than when it is not.},

In this paper we discuss the characteristics of the various media and environments in which humor can emerge.

The combined use of both quantitative and qualitative methods, based on certain epistemological assumptions, aims to understand in a more holistic way various educational phenomena. The purpose of this paper is to present a reflection on the lessons learned that the author synthesizes from his work as an adviser of five doctoral theses using these methods. The results highlight five lessons learned about methodological references, philosophical foundations, methodological variations, precision of terms, and students' training.},

Our approach combines interviews with Q-methodology, a method from psychology uniquely suited to quantifying opinions. We derive the framework for structured data collection and analysis for the Q-methodology from theories of selfmanagement of chronic illness and technology adoption. To illustrate the power of this new approach, we used it in a field study of nine older adults with type 2 diabetes, and nine mothers of children with asthma. Our mixed-methods approach provides three key advantages for health design science in {HCI}: (1) it provides a structured health sciences theoretical framework to guide data collection and analysis; (2) it enhances the coding of unstructured data with statistical patterns of polarizing and consensus views; and (3) it empowers participants to actively weigh competing values that are most personally significant to them.},

Within this main objective, a subset of two additional goals was identiﬁed: ﬁrst, to analyze whether the sense of presence would differ across emotionally charged {VEs}, and second, to examine the link between a more objective measure of affective arousal, electrodermal activity ({EDA}), and presence. Following a between-subject design, 120 students were randomly assigned to one of the ﬁve {VEs}. Results show that almost all of the ﬁve virtual park scenarios were able to elicit the intended emotion. Additionally, presence levels were the same across all {VEs} suggesting that presence did not confound the emotional reaction to the {VEs}. Furthermore, {EDA} seems to be a poor indicator of presence as it is not signiﬁcantly correlated with self-reported presence. The implications of these ﬁndings for both future research and practice are addressed in a comprehensive discussion.},

While there are several similarities, such as emphasizing divergent results and allowing for researcher choice in methods, each perspective offers a unique set of advantages and disadvantages.

We contend that the best way to accomplish this is by eliminating quantitative research methodology and qualitative research methodology courses from curricula and replacing these with research methodology courses at diﬀerent levels that simultaneously teach both quantitative and qualitative techniques within a mixed methodological framework.},

Different types of presence are discussed, including physical presence, social presence, and co-presence. Fidelity-based approaches to presence research emphasize the fact that as media become increasingly interactive, perceptually realistic, and immersive, the experience of presence becomes more convincing. In addition, the ecological-cultural approach is described, pointing out the importance of the possibility of action in mediated environments, as well as the role that a common cultural framework plays in engendering a sense of presence. In particular for multi-user or collaborative virtual environments ({CVEs}), processes of negotiation and community creation need to be supported by the {CVE} design to enable communication and the creation of a social context within the {CVE}.},

Although research into presence is still at an early stage of development, there is a consensus that presence has multiple determinants. To identify and test which parameters affect presence, a reliable, robust and valid means of measuring presence is required. In this paper, we describe the categories of factors thought to have an impact on presence. Furthermore, we present an overview of various approaches taken to measuring presence, which can be divided into two general categories: subjective measures and objective corroborative measures. Since presence is a subjective experience, the most direct way of assessment is through users’ subjective report. This approach has serious limitations however, and should be used judiciously. Objective measures, such as postural, physiological or social responses to media, can be used to corroborate subjective measures, thereby overcoming some of their limitations. At present, the most promising direction for presence measurement is to develop and use an aggregate measure of presence that is comprised of both subjective and objective components, tailored to the specific medium under study.},

But how do we determine the extent to which a user feels present in the virtual environment? This chapter examines three categories of methods commonly used for measuring presence; their use in the field, advantages, and disadvantages. Subjective measures rely on self-assessment by the user. Users answer questions such as "How real did the environment seem to you?", "Was the environment like a place you visited, or a series of images presented to you?". Behavioral measures examine actions or manners exhibited by the user that are responses to objects or events in the virtual environment. For example, does the user duck if a virtual object is thrown at his head. Physiological methods attempt to measure presence by gauging changes in the subject's heart rate, skin temperature, skin conductance, breathing rate, etc. In a stress-inducing virtual environment does the user exhibit physiological signs of stress? How do these methods compare when using the criteria of reliability, validity, objectivity, and sensitivity.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a ﬁrst study in which a recently reported intermodal perceptual illusion known as the rubber hand illusion is experimentally investigated under mediated conditions. When one’s own hand is placed out of view and a visible fake hand is repeatedly stroked and tapped in synchrony with the unseen hand, subjects report a strong sense in which the fake hand is experienced as part of their own body. In our experiment, we investigated this illusion under three conditions: (i) unmediated condition, replicating the original paradigm, (ii) virtual reality ({VR}) condition, where both the fake hand and its stimulation were projected on the table in front of the participant, and (iii) mixed reality ({MR}) condition, where the fake hand was projected, but its stimulation was unmediated. Dependent measures included self-report (open-ended and questionnaire-based) and drift, that is, the offset between the felt position of the hidden hand and its actual position. As expected, the unmediated condition produced the strongest illusion, as indicated both by selfreport and drift towards the rubber hand. The {VR} condition produced a more convincing subjective illusion than the {MR} condition, although no difference in drift was found between the mediated conditions. Results are discussed in terms of perceptual mechanisms underlying the rubber hand illusion, and the illusion’s relevance to understanding telepresence.},

We create variations in presence by asking participants to collaborate on physical tasks in four {CMC} conditions. We then correlate self-reported feelings of presence with the use of specific linguistic features. Regression analyses show that 30\% of the variance in self-reported presence can be accounted for by a small number of task-independent linguistic features. Even better prediction can be obtained when self-reported coordination is added to the regression equation. We conclude that linguistic measures of presence have value for studies of {CMC}.},

A statistical methodology has been developed to model the system conversational behavior, which is learned from an initial corpus and improved with the knowledge acquired from the successive interactions. In addition, the selection of the next system response is adapted considering information stored into user’s proﬁles and also the emotional contents detected in the user’s utterances. Our proposal has been evaluated with the successful development of an embodied conversational agent which has been placed in the Second Life social virtual world. The avatar includes the different models and interacts with the users who inhabit the virtual world in order to provide academic information. The experimental results show that the agent’s conversational behavior adapts successfully to the speciﬁc characteristics of users interacting in such environments.},

	abstract = {Scientific knowledge is still limited about the effect of commercial virtual reality content, such as experiences developed for advertising purposes, on individual emotional experience. In addition, even though correlations between emotional responses and perceived sense of presence in virtual reality have often been reported, the relationship remains unclear. Some studies have suggested an important effect of ease of interaction on both emotions and the sense of presence, but only a few studies have scientifically explored this topic. Within this context, this study aimed to: (a) test the effect of inducing positive emotions of a commercial virtual experience developed for the promotion of an urban renewal project, (b) investigate the relationship between positive emotions and the perceived sense of presence, and (c) explore the association between the ease of interaction of the virtual experience with positive emotions and the sense of presence reported by the users. Sixty-one participants were recruited from visitors to the 2017 Milan Design Week “Fuorisalone” event. A survey was administered before and after the experience to collect information about users’ demographics, positive emotions, sense of presence, and the ease of interaction with the virtual content. Results give evidence that: (a) the commercial virtual reality experience was able to induce positive emotions; (b) the positive emotions reported by users were associated with the sense of presence experienced in the virtual environment, with a directional effect from emotion to sense of presence; and (c) the easier the interaction, the more the sense of presence and positive emotions were reported by users.},

This paper considers these implications by examining the continuities and discontinuities between the Self in virtual and non-virtual environments, and contemporary and historical settings. Symbolic Interaction and Activity Theory approaches emphasise the Self as emerging in context, through Self-Other and Selfenvironment interactions in the minutiae of everyday life, but to some extent foreground physical rather than virtual interactions. Interactions in virtual environments are characterised by specific forms of embodiment and the experience of “presence”, with avatars providing embodiment for interaction separate from the physical world and interaction with others being one of the determinants of presence. The complexion of Self-Other interactions in virtual environments is circumscribed by the characteristics of communications and relationships that occur in them, which are constrained by reduced social cues but overcome through the invention of techniques driven by the desire to socially interact. This paper highlights the role of symbolic mediation in the emergence of Self in virtual environments and posits that, while emergence of Self is interactive in nature, virtual environments are particular sites for a Self where the specific role of social interaction must be foregrounded.},

This study examined self-reported, autonomic and endocrine stress responses to a 5-min public speaking task. Participants were asked to present either in front of i) a real audience, or ii) a virtual audience or iii) an empty virtual lecture hall. Thus, the main objective of this study was to examine the inﬂuence of real or virtual social stimuli on stress reactivity. Additionally, possible sex differences in stress responses were evaluated. Sixty-six women and men (20e33 years) underwent a multidimensional assessment of stress including self-reported state anxiety, heart rate, heart rate variability and saliva cortisol secretion. Results showed comparable increases in all stress responses in both the real and the virtual public speaking group. These ﬁndings indicate that the Self Preservation Theory is not limited to physically present social entities, but may also be extended to virtual social stimuli; as such this observation is also in line with the so called Media Equation Concept. Implications of the current results for therapy and research are subsequently discussed.},

	abstract = {The ‘‘mediated sense of presence’’ is a technology-induced illusion of being present in one (simulated) place when one is actually present in another (physical) place. Typically experienced in virtual worlds, mediated presence is generated by different technological, cognitive, and emotional factors. The aim of this study was to test how to optimise the virtual experience by manipulating some of these factors. Speciﬁcally, we tested if an immersive technology and/or a meaningful narrative context inﬂuence the users’ sense of presence, providing a more compelling experience than a non-immersive and non-contextualized virtual space. Eighty-four students, randomly divided into four groups, were asked to ﬁnd a blood container inside a virtual hospital in an immersive or non-immersive condition and with or without an emotionally related narrative. Two presence questionnaires and heart-rate variations were used to measure the effects of the four conditions on the users’ sense of presence. Results showed a signiﬁcant effect of narrative, F(8, 73) ¼ 30.346, p {\textless} 0.001, and level of immersion, F (8, 73) ¼ 10.913, p {\textless} 0.001, and a signiﬁcant interaction between narrative and immersion, F(8, 73) ¼ 2.062, p ¼ 0.05, both on the presence questionnaires and on the heart-rate variations. Moreover, considering the factors immersion (I) and narrative (N) together, we found that the I–N condition generated the highest level of presence. We argue that both immersion and narrative are important in creating an effective virtual reality experience because they contribute differently to increasing the sense of presence. Immersion increases the place illusion, while the narrative contributes to generating an emotional response and strengthening the subjects’ sense of inner presence.},

In contrast to a web site, for example, where a user interacts with a two-dimensional site, virtual worlds provide a platform in which users can interact with other individuals, sometimes including strangers, within three-dimensional environments. Virtual worlds afford a form of ‘socialness’ unlike many other technologies, often motivating a user – by virtue of these social experiences – to return. Drawing on the Spatial Model of Interaction and Awareness-Attention Theory, we demonstrate that besides social aspects, which include social awareness and social perception, ﬂow experience, which is the mental state of being fully absorbed and somewhat lost in time, is an essential ingredient in an individual’s decision to return to a virtual world. We also demonstrate how characteristics of the technology are linked to the social aspects experienced in virtual worlds. A laboratory study conducted in a virtual world, Second Life, supports our assertions and identiﬁes state predictors of ﬂow that inﬂuence individuals’ intentions to return to the virtual world environment.},

Our proposal combines different techniques related to Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Affective Computing, and User Modeling. A statistical methodology has been developed to model the system conversational behavior, which is learned from an initial corpus and improved with the knowledge acquired from the successive interactions. In addition, the selection of the next system response is adapted considering information stored into user’s proﬁles and also the emotional contents detected in the user’s utterances. Our proposal has been evaluated with the successful development of an embodied conversational agent which has been placed in the Second Life social virtual world. The avatar includes the different models and interacts with the users who inhabit the virtual world in order to provide academic information. The experimental results show that the agent’s conversational behavior adapts successfully to the speciﬁc characteristics of users interacting in such environments.},

While a number of studies have successfully manipulated this emotion, the issue of how to elicit particularly intense awe experiences in laboratory settings remains. We suggest that virtual reality ({VR}) is a particularly effective mood induction tool for eliciting awe. {VR} provides three key assets for improving awe. First, {VR} provides users with immersive and ecological yet controlled environments that can elicit a sense of “presence,” the subjective experience of “being there” in a simulated reality. Further, {VR} can be used to generate complex, vast stimuli, which can target speciﬁc theoretical facets of awe. Finally, {VR} allows for convenient tracking of participants’ behavior and physiological responses, allowing for more integrated assessment of emotional experience. We discussed the potential and challenges of the proposed approach with an emphasis on {VR}’s capacity to raise the signal of reactions to emotions such as awe in laboratory settings.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality exposure therapy has been proposed as a viable alternative in the treatment of anxiety disorders, including social anxiety disorder. Therapists could benefit from extensive control of anxiety eliciting stimuli during virtual exposure. Two stimuli controls are studied in this study: the social dialogue situation, and the dialogue feedback responses (negative or positive) between a human and a virtual character. In the first study, 16 participants were exposed in three virtual reality scenarios: a neutral virtual world, blind date scenario, and job interview scenario. Results showed a significant difference between the three virtual scenarios in the level of self-reported anxiety and heart rate. In the second study, 24 participants were exposed to a job interview scenario in a virtual environment where the ratio between negative and positive dialogue feedback responses of a virtual character was systematically varied on-the-fly. Results yielded that within a dialogue the more positive dialogue feedback resulted in less self-reported anxiety, lower heart rate, and longer answers, while more negative dialogue feedback of the virtual character resulted in the opposite. The correlations between on the one hand the dialogue stressor ratio and on the other hand the means of {SUD} score, heart rate and audio length in the eight dialogue conditions showed a strong relationship: r(6) = 0.91, p = 0.002; r(6) = 0.76, p = 0.028 and r(6) = 20.94, p = 0.001 respectively. Furthermore, more anticipatory anxiety reported before exposure was found to coincide with more self-reported anxiety, and shorter answers during the virtual exposure. These results demonstrate that social dialogues in a virtual environment can be effectively manipulated for therapeutic purposes.},

The main goal of this study was to analyze the possible use of {VR} as an affective medium. Within this general goal, the study also analyzed the relationship between presence and emotions. The results confirmed the efficacy of {VR} as affective medium: the interaction with “anxious” and “relaxing” virtual environments produced anxiety and relaxation. The data also showed a circular interaction between presence and emotions: on one side, the feeling of presence was greater in the “emotional” environments; on the other side, the emotional state was influenced by the level of presence.

Despite this phenomenon having been studied primarily in the ﬁeld of virtual reality (conceived as the illusion of being in the virtual space), recent research highlighted that it is a fundamental feature of everyday experience. Speciﬁcally, the function of presence as a cognitive process is to locate the Self in a physical space or situation, based on the perceived possibility to act in it; so, the variations in sense of presence allow one to continuously adapt his own action to the external environment. Indeed intentions, as the cognitive antecedents of action, are not static representations of the desired outcomes, but dynamic processes able to adjust their own representational content according to the opportunities/restrictions emerging in the environment. Focusing on the peculiar context of action mediated by interactive technologies, we here propose a theoretical model showing how each level of an intentional hierarchy (future-directed; present directed; and motor intentions) can “interlock” with environmental affordances in order to promote a continuous stream of action and activity.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality ({VR}) has made its way into mainstream psychological research in the last two decades. This technology, with its unique ability to simulate complex, real situations and contexts, offers researchers unprecedented opportunities to investigate human behavior in well controlled designs in the laboratory. One important application {ofVR} is the investigation of pathological processes in mental disorders, especially anxiety disorders. Research on the processes underlying threat perception, fear, and exposure therapy has shed light on more general aspects of the relation between perception and emotion. Being by its nature virtual, i.e., simulation of reality, {VR} strongly relies on the adequate selection of speciﬁc perceptual cues to activate emotions. Emotional experiences in turn are related to presence, another important concept in {VR}, which describes the user’s sense of being in a {VR} environment. This paper summarizes current research into perception of fear cues, emotion, and presence, aiming at the identiﬁcation of the most relevant aspects of emotional experience in {VR} and their mutual relations. A special focus lies on a series of recent experiments designed to test the relative contribution of perception and conceptual information on fear in {VR}. This strand of research capitalizes on the dissociation between perception (bottom–up input) and conceptual information (top-down input) that is possible in {VR}. Further, we review the factors that have so far been recognized to inﬂuence presence, with emotions (e.g., fear) being the most relevant in the context of clinical psychology. Recent research has highlighted the mutual inﬂuence of presence and fear in {VR}, but has also traced the limits of our current understanding of this relationship. In this paper, the crucial role of perception on eliciting emotional reactions is highlighted, and the role of arousal as a basic dimension of emotional experience is discussed. An interoceptive attribution model of presence is suggested as a ﬁrst step toward an integrative framework for emotion research in {VR}. Gaps in the current literature and future directions are outlined.},

The proliferation of geographically distributed teams, striving towards innovative results, calls for {ICT} that support team creativity. Three-dimensional virtual worlds represent such an emergent and rapidly developing collaboration tool. A systematic literature review was conducted to reveal the affordances of virtual worlds contributing towards team creativity. The results of the literature review reveal eight proposed affordances relevant for virtual worlds to foster team level creativity. Avatars (1) allow the team members to express themselves and their insights and point out information to others. Changing the users’ frame of reference (2) embraces the virtual world’s potential as a context for creative action. Perceived feeling of co-presence (3) within the team members, and user’s own experience of immersion (4), contributes towards engaging creative team collaboration. Multimodality (5) and rich visual information (6) facilitate communication between team members. Finally, virtual worlds allow teams to modify the collaboration environment to simulate a new kind of reality (7), and offer a selection of supporting tools (8) that can be utilized in the creative collaboration. Departures for further research efforts and insights for practitioners engaged in virtual world collaboration are presented.},

	abstract = {The social facilitation effect describes the change in the performance of the task under the influence of the presence of observers. The effect itself consists of two components: social facilitation in simple tasks and social inhibition in complex tasks. In the context of the dynamic development of new technologies, the question of the possible influence on human behavior by virtual characters gains importance. We attempted to critically describe and summarize current research on social facilitation in order to answer the question of whether it occurs in virtual environments. We found 13 relevant studies, 3 of which demonstrated social facilitation, 4 social inhibition and 1 demonstrated the whole effect. The conclusions drawn from the analysis are ambiguous. Firstly, we identified that 12 out of 13 analyzed studies failed to show the whole effect. Secondly, we encountered several shortcomings of the summarized research that further complicated its interpretation. The shortcomings: presence of the researcher, unclear usage of “agent” and “avatar”, evaluation of activation, no pilot tests of observers and no description of how their characteristics are generated, among others, are discussed. Furthermore, we investigated the effect sizes and their variability. The average effect size for social facilitation was g = 0.18, {CI} [-0.28; 0.64] and for social inhibition g = -0.18, {CI} [-0.40; 0.04]. In social facilitation, a substantial level of heterogeneity was detected. Finally, we conclude that it is still too early to provide a definite answer to the question of whether social facilitation exists in Virtual Environments. We recommend limiting evaluation activation to the lowest possible level, conducting pilot tests prior to the experiment, avoiding the presence of the researcher in the experimental room and a clear distinction of “agent” and “avatar”, as measures to achieve a better quality in future research.},

However, {CVEs} differ in type of avatar representation and level of behavioral realism afforded to users. The present investigation compared the effect of behavioral realism on users’ nonverbal behavior, self-presence, social presence, and interpersonal attraction during a dyadic interaction. Fifty-one dyads (aged 18 to 26) embodied either a full-bodied avatar with mapped hands and inferred arm movements, an avatar consisting of only a floating head and mapped hands, or a static full-bodied avatar. Planned contrasts compared the effect of behavioral realism against no behavioral realism, and compared the effect of low versus high behavioral realism. Results show that participants who embodied the avatar with only a floating head and hands experienced greater social presence, selfpresence, and interpersonal attraction than participants who embodied a full-bodied avatar with mapped hands. In contrast, there were no significant differences on these measures between participants in the two mapped-hands conditions and those who embodied a static avatar. Participants in the static-avatar condition rotated their own physical head and hands significantly less than participants in the other two conditions during the dyadic interaction. Additionally, side-to-side head movements were negatively correlated with interpersonal attraction regardless of condition. We discuss implications of the finding that behavioral realism influences nonverbal behavior and communication outcomes.},

In Experiment 2, individual participants using a Ku Klux Klan ({KKK})-associated avatar created more aggressive Thematic Apperception Test stories in comparison to a control group. Participants using the {KKK} avatar also wrote less affiliative stories in comparison to those employing avatars dressed as doctors. Overall, the resulting pattern of activation of negative thoughts (i.e., aggression) coupled with the inhibition of inconsistent thoughts (i.e., cohesion, affiliation) is consistent with principles of current priming models and provides initial evidence for automatic cognitive priming in virtual settings.},

In the current study, participants interacted with an embodied artiﬁcial intelligence agent in immersive virtual reality. The agent either mimicked a participant’s head movements at a 4-s delay or utilized prerecorded movements of another participant as it verbally presented an argument. Mimicking agents were more persuasive and received more positive trait ratings than nonmimickers, despite participants’ inability to explicitly detect the mimicry. These data are uniquely powerful because they demonstrate the ability to use automatic, indiscriminate mimicking (i.e., a computer algorithm blindly applied to all movements) to gain social inﬂuence. Furthermore, this is the ﬁrst study to demonstrate social inﬂuence effects with a nonhuman, nonverbal mimicker.},

	abstract = {The link between anxiety and presence in a virtual environment ({VE}) is still a subject of an unresolved debate, with little empirical research to support theoretical claims. Thus, the current study analyzed presence, selfreported anxiety, and a physiological parameter (heart rate [{HR}]) in a sample of 30 high anxious and 35 low anxious participants. Both groups delivered a 5 minute speech in a virtual lecture hall. Results indicate no mediating inﬂuences of presence on group differences in self-reported state anxiety during the speech, but point toward negative correlations between state anxiety and the {iGroup} Presence Questionnaire ({IPQ}) scales ‘‘sense of being there’’ and ‘‘realism.’’ Furthermore, {HR} was found to be unrelated to self-reported presence. Only the {IPQ} scale ‘‘spatial presence’’ showed a marginally signiﬁcant inﬂuence on group differences in state anxiety. The present results support the assumption that presence and anxiety are logically distinct, meaning that presence does not directly inﬂuence the intensity of an emotion felt in a {VE}. Rather, it constitutes a precondition for an emotion to be at all elicited by a {VE}. Also, {HR} has proven to be no adequate substitute measure for presence, since it only assesses anxiety not presence. It may, however, mediate the interplay between trait anxiety and state anxiety. Possible implications of the current ﬁndings are discussed alongside the problem of using presence questionnaires that seem to be prone to subjective bias (i.e., participants confusing presence and emotion).},

Using 21 adults with Social Anxiety Disorder ({SAD}) and 24 adults with no disorder, this study had three objectives: (a) to determine whether speaking to a virtual audience elicited significant increases in physiological response (e.g., heart rate, electrodermal activity, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia) and subjective distress over baseline resting conditions (b) to determine if individuals with {SAD} had a greater increase in physiological arousal and subjective distress when speaking in front of a live audience vs. the virtual environment and (c) to determine whether individuals with {SAD} had greater changes in physiological and self-reported arousal during each speech task compared to controls. All participants gave an impromptu speech in front of an in vivo and {VR} audience while measures of physiological arousal and self-reported distress were obtained. Results demonstrated that the {VR} task elicited significant increases in heart rate, electrodermal activity, and respiratory sinus arrhythmia, and self-reported distress over baseline conditions but was less anxiety-producing than the in vivo speech task. In addition, participants reported a moderate level of presence in the {VR} task, but significantly less than in the in vivo task. No group differences were found on physiological measures. Clinical implications of these findings and the role of {VR} in the treatment of {SAD} are discussed.},

Sixty participants (Mage ¼ 36.9 years; 63.3\% women) diagnosed with social anxiety disorder were randomly assigned to individual virtual reality exposure therapy ({VRET}), individual in vivo exposure therapy ({iVET}), or waiting-list. Multilevel regression analyses revealed that both treatment groups improved from pre-to postassessment on social anxiety symptoms, speech duration, perceived stress, and avoidant personality disorder related beliefs when compared to the waiting-list. Participants receiving {iVET}, but not {VRET}, improved on fear of negative evaluation, speech performance, general anxiety, depression, and quality of life relative to those on waiting-list. The {iVET} condition was further superior to the {VRET} condition regarding decreases in social anxiety symptoms at post- and follow-up assessments, and avoidant personality disorder related beliefs at follow-up. At follow-up, all improvements were signiﬁcant for {iVET}. For {VRET}, only the effect for perceived stress was signiﬁcant. {VRET} containing extensive verbal interaction without any cognitive components can effectively reduce complaints of generalized social anxiety disorder. Future technological and psychological improvements of virtual social interactions might further enhance the efﬁcacy of {VRET} for social anxiety disorder.},

Our native Dutch participants were immersed in a virtual environment in which they encountered virtual persons (avatars) with either white or Moroccan facial features. In line with our predictions, participants maintained more distance and showed an increase in skin conductance level when approaching Moroccan avatars as opposed to white avatars. Participants’ implicit negative associations with Moroccans moderated both effects. Moreover, evidence was found that the relation between implicit prejudice and distance effects was fully mediated by skin conductance level effects. These data demonstrate how prejudiced implicit associations may unintentionally lead to impulsive discriminatory responses.},

A 2 Â 2 experiment, the ﬁrst of its kind, examined how self-perception and attitudes changed after women (N = 86) entered a fully immersive virtual environment and embodied sexualized or nonsexualized avatars which featured either the participant’s face or the face of an unknown other. Findings supported the Proteus effect. Participants who wore sexualized avatars internalized the avatar’s appearance and selfobjectiﬁed, reporting more body-related thoughts than those wearing nonsexualized avatars. Participants who saw their own faces, particularly on sexualized avatars, expressed more rape myth acceptance than those in other conditions. Implications for both online and ofﬂine consequences of using sexualized avatars are discussed.},

Results supported the notion that gender-matched avatars increase the likelihood of gender-typical language use, whereas gender-mismatched avatars promoted countertypical language, especially among women.The gender of a partner’s avatar, however, did not influence participants’ language.

Objectification theory suggests that women’s exposure to sexualized media representations leads to self-objectification. Further, we anticipated this process would lead to increases in rape myth acceptance ({RMA}). Two experiments (Study 1, N ¼ 87; Study 2, N ¼ 81) examined the effects of avatar features on women’s experiences of self-objectification. In both studies, college women exposed to sexualized avatars experienced higher levels of self-objectification after the virtual experience than those exposed to nonsexualized avatars. Furthermore, in Study 2, self-objectification mediated the relationship between controlling a sexualized avatar and subsequent levels of {RMA}. We discuss the implications of women using sexualized avatars in video games and virtual environments, which may lead to negative attitudes about the self and other women off-line due to heightened selfobjectification.

But online users can appear in guises that differ from their physical sex. An empirical study was conducted in an online game to examine whether users’ avatars’ gender influences how they seek and receive help. Analysis is based on user-to-user communications and backend data. Results indicate that male avatars are less likely to receive sought-for help than female avatars and more likely to be the recipients of indirectly sought help. The authors conclude that avatar gender influences help seeking independent of physical sex: Men overcome their inhibition for help seeking when using female avatars. Practitioners should ensure that means for indirect help seeking are available in order not to exclude male-pattern help seekers.},

Given that popular virtual worlds (e.g., Second Life [{SL}]) are often criticized for Whiteavatar dominance or White bias, we examined the psychological effects of the alleged White dominance in avatar-based virtual worlds by conducting two experiments in which participants read ﬁctitious proﬁles of {SL} resident avatars. White and non-White participants were randomly assigned to view either a set of Whitedominant avatar proﬁles or a set of racially diverse ones. After reading the proﬁles, participants had an opportunity to customize avatars using the {SL} interface. The ﬁndings of Experiment 1 (n = 59) revealed that {nonWhite} participants exposed to the White-dominant avatar proﬁles, when compared with those exposed to the racially diverse proﬁles, reported signiﬁcantly lower levels of sense of belonging and intention to participate in {SL}. Experiment 2 (n = 64) demonstrated that non-White participants exposed to the White-dominant avatar proﬁles gave signiﬁcantly higher estimation of the White user population within {SL}; the data also showed that exposure to the White-dominant avatar proﬁles resulted in a greater sense of limitation on skin customization among non-White participants than among White participants. The present research suggests that ethno-racial minorities, when exposed to avatar-based cues that signal White dominance, may perceive the virtual world as identity threatening, thereby feeling psychologically disconnected and detached from it. Implications regarding racial/ethnic diversity in virtual worlds are discussed.},

We also test if a virtual emergency is actually reacted to as an emergency. We use an immersive virtual environment ({IVE}) where a victim issues help requests during two different emergency situations (time pressure or ﬁre). While experiencing the emergency, white participants (N = 96) receive a request for help from a black or white virtual human. The results show a psychological response to the virtual experience consistent with an emergency situation (increased state anxiety and increased frequency of collisions with objects in the environment) and biased by racial discrimination in help provision. In addition, racial discrimination increases under time pressure, but not in a ﬁre. The implications for virtual training are discussed.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have investigated how existing social attitudes towards other races affect the way we ‘share’ their bodily experiences, for example in empathy for pain, and sensorimotor mapping. Here, we ask whether it is possible to alter implicit racial attitudes by experimentally increasing self-other bodily overlap. Employing a bodily illusion known as the ‘Rubber Hand Illusion’, we delivered multisensory stimulation to light-skinned Caucasian participants to induce the feeling that a dark-skinned hand belonged to them. We then measured whether this could change their implicit racial biases against people with dark skin. Across two experiments, the more intense the participants’ illusion of ownership over the dark-skinned rubber hand, the more positive their implicit racial attitudes became. Importantly, it was not the pattern of multisensory stimulation per se, but rather, it was the change in the subjective experience of body ownership that altered implicit attitudes. These ﬁndings suggest that inducing an overlap between the bodies of self and other through illusory ownership is an effective way to change and reduce negative implicit attitudes towards outgroups.},

Here we demonstrate that embodiment of light-skinned participants in a dark-skinned {VB} signiﬁcantly reduced implicit racial bias against darkskinned people, in contrast to embodiment in light-skinned, purple-skinned or with no {VB}. 60 females participated in this between-groups experiment, with a {VB} substituting their own, with full-body visuomotor synchrony, reﬂected also in a virtual mirror. A racial Implicit Association Test ({IAT}) was administered at least three days prior to the experiment, and immediately after the {IVR} exposure. The change from pre- to post-experience {IAT} scores suggests that the dark-skinned embodied condition decreased implicit racial bias more than the other conditions.

This project asks users to describe the Buddy Icons they are currently using and what they intend to self-present in selecting them to test the extent to which self presentation theory can explain the choices people are making. Overall, participants reported that they felt their Buddy Icons accurately reﬂected physical characteristics, psychological aspects of the self, or both, which is consistent with previous research that people are relatively honest in their self-presentation online. Those who selected more human like (anthropomorphic) Buddy Icons reported them as more representative of the physical, as opposed to the psychological, self. Finally, users who felt their Buddy Icon accurately represented them reported a stronger sense of identiﬁcation and felt their Buddy Icon could increase social presence. Implications of these results for online self presentation and impression management are discussed.},

We find that people in groups with a robot making vulnerable statements converse substantially more with each other, distribute their conversation somewhat more equally, and perceive their groups more positively compared to control groups with a robot that either makes neutral statements or no statements at the end of each round. Shifts in robot speech have the power not only to affect how people interact with robots, but also how people interact with each other, offering the prospect for modifying social interactions via the introduction of artificial agents into hybrid systems of humans and machines.},

This paper describes two Virtual Environments ({VEs}) that were used as mood induction procedures ({MIPs}) for this population. In addition, the {VEs}’ efﬁcacy at increasing joy and relaxation in elderly users is analyzed. The {VEs} contain exercises for generating positive-autobiographic memories, mindfulness and slow breathing rhythms. The total sample comprised 18 participants over 55 years old who used the {VEs} on two occasions. Twelve of them used the joy environment, while 16 used the relaxation environment. Moods before and after each session were assessed using Visual Analogical Scales. After using both {VEs}, results indicated significant increases in joy and relaxation and signiﬁcant decreases in sadness and anxiety. The participants also indicated low levels of difﬁculty of use and high levels of satisfaction and sense of presence. Hence, the {VEs} demonstrate their usefulness at promoting positive affects and enhancing the wellbeing of elderly people.},

	abstract = {The ‘‘mediated sense of presence’’ is a technology-induced illusion of being present in one (simulated) place when one is actually present in another (physical) place. Typically experienced in virtual worlds, mediated presence is generated by different technological, cognitive, and emotional factors. The aim of this study was to test how to optimise the virtual experience by manipulating some of these factors. Speciﬁcally, we tested if an immersive technology and/or a meaningful narrative context inﬂuence the users’ sense of presence, providing a more compelling experience than a non-immersive and non-contextualized virtual space. Eighty-four students, randomly divided into four groups, were asked to ﬁnd a blood container inside a virtual hospital in an immersive or non-immersive condition and with or without an emotionally related narrative. Two presence questionnaires and heart-rate variations were used to measure the effects of the four conditions on the users’ sense of presence. Results showed a signiﬁcant effect of narrative, F(8, 73) ¼ 30.346, p {\textless} 0.001, and level of immersion, F (8, 73) ¼ 10.913, p {\textless} 0.001, and a signiﬁcant interaction between narrative and immersion, F(8, 73) ¼ 2.062, p ¼ 0.05, both on the presence questionnaires and on the heart-rate variations. Moreover, considering the factors immersion (I) and narrative (N) together, we found that the I–N condition generated the highest level of presence. We argue that both immersion and narrative are important in creating an effective virtual reality experience because they contribute differently to increasing the sense of presence. Immersion increases the place illusion, while the narrative contributes to generating an emotional response and strengthening the subjects’ sense of inner presence.},

	abstract = {Recent reviews point towards that Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy ({VRET}) can be an effective medium to provide exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. The concept of presence, usually deﬁned as the sense of being inside the virtual environment, has been considered the principal mechanism that leads to the experience of anxiety in clinical virtual environments. The present study sought to examine the relationship between sense of presence and in-session anxiety in a sample of 210 students showing high and low test anxiety when exposed to both clinical and non-stressful virtual environments. This is the largest study conducted to date with the aim of examining the relationship between presence and anxiety in clinical virtual environments, and the ﬁrst to explore separately the relationship between presence and state-anxiety in phobic and non-phobic participants. The results suggest that presence was not related to anxiety in a non-stressful environment. It was also found that although presence is related to anxiety in both groups of students when exposed to clinical virtual environments, this relationship was clearly stronger for high test anxiety students. This line of research will broaden our understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the efﬁcacy of {VRET}.},

The prevalence and impact of public speaking anxiety as a type of Social Phobia are discussed. Studies of {VRT} as an emerging treatment for psychological problems are reviewed. In the present study, eight students completed {VRT} individual treatment and post-testing, and six students in a Wait-List control group completed post-testing. Assessment measures included four selfreport inventories, self-report of Subjective Units of Discomfort during exposure to {VRT} and physiological measurements of heart rate during speaking tasks. Four weekly individual exposure treatment sessions of approximately 15 min each were conducted by the author serving as therapist. Results on self-report and physiological measures appear to indicate that four virtual reality treatment sessions were effective in reducing public speaking anxiety in university students, corroborating earlier studies of {VRT}’s effectiveness as a psychotherapeutic modality. Future research directions are discussed, primarily the need for research on younger populations, to assess the effectiveness of {VRT} for earlier intervention with public speaking anxiety.},

This paper reports a preliminary study in which a virtual reality therapy ({VRT}), based on exposure to virtual environments, was used to treat social phobia. The sample consisted of 36 participants diagnosed with social phobia assigned to either {VRT} or a group-{CBT} (control condition). The virtual environments used in the treatment recreate four situations dealing with social anxiety: performance, intimacy, scrutiny, and assertiveness. With the help of the therapist, the patient learns adapted cognitions and behaviors in order to reduce anxiety in the corresponding real situations. Both treatments lasted 12 weeks, and sessions were delivered according to a treatment manual. Results showed statistically and clinically significant improvement in both conditions. The effect-sizes comparing the efficacy of {VRT} to the control traditional group-{CBT} revealed that the differences between the two treatments are trivial.},

Graded exposure to feared social situations is fundamental to obtain an improvement of the anxious symptoms. Traditionally, exposure therapies are done either in vivo or by imagining the situations. In vivo exposure is sometimes difficult to control and many patients have some difficulties in using imagination. Virtual reality ({VR}) seems to bring significant advantages. It allows exposures to numerous and varied situations. This paper reports the definition of a clinical protocol whose purpose is to assess the efficiency of a {VR} therapy compared to a {CBT} and to the absence of treatment for social phobic patients. It explains the illness’ diagnosis and its usual treatments. It exposes all the architecture of the study, the assessment tools, the content and unfold of the therapy sessions. It finally reports first results of a clinical trial in a betweengroup design in 10 patients suffering from social phobia. The virtual environments used in the treatment reproduce four situations that social phobics feel the most threatening: performance, intimacy, scrutiny and assertiveness. With the help of the therapist, the patient learns adapted cognitions and behaviors with the aim of reducing her or his anxiety in the corresponding real situations. The novelty of our work is to address a group of situations that the phobic patient is most likely to experience and to treat patients according to a precise protocol.},

The present work is an empirical study of the role of self-presence in a social virtual world on individuals’ ofﬂine health, appearance, and well-being. Second Life users (N = 279) completed an online questionnaire about their experiences of presence in the virtual world, the inﬂuence of their avatar on their ofﬂine appearance and health behaviors, and their level of satisfaction with the relationships they developed online. It was hypothesized that self-presence would be positively associated with avatar inﬂuence on health and appearance and that self-presence would render the inﬂuence of spatial and social presence statistically non-signiﬁcant. Additionally, it was hypothesized that self-presence would be positively associated with satisfaction with relationships developed in the virtual world. Support was found for these predictions. Results suggest that selfpresence is uniquely linked to the inﬂuence of the virtual self on ofﬂine health and appearance and is a signiﬁcant predictor of the development of satisfying online relationships. Individual differences and potential prosocial effects of virtual worlds are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Creative idea generation, the generation of original yet effective ideas, can be supported in virtual environments when interactions are facilitated via avatars with an appearance similar to their user, i.e. self-similar avatars. However, it is not known how self-similar avatars support creative idea generation. We propose that self-similarity supports the generation of original ideas, because it (i) increases the identification a user has with its avatar, which (ii) increases positive affect, and (iii) influences the positive affect-original idea generation link. To test this conjecture, an experiment was conducted where people composed their own avatar to be either self-similar or non-self-similar, which they then used to engage in two idea generation tasks presented within a custom virtual environment. The results suggest that using a self-similar rather than a non-self-similar avatar positively influences the generation of original ideas; and that this depends on the influence of self-similarity on the link between identification and positive affect. Thus, this paper contributes a mechanism that explains how self-similar avatars support the generation of original ideas.},

Unlike a human, it can be expected that the bird avatar can leads to give psychological effects in a flight experience, because a bird has flight ability. Our previous study reported that the bird avatar enhances the sense of flight significantly (i.e. participants feel as though they are flying in the sky.) than a human avatar in a flight experience. In this present work, we investigate about changes in attitudes with the fear of heights. We conduct experiments where an avatar is raised to a specific altitude after inducing the sense of body ownership. There are no significant differences between conditions.

This effect describes changes in attitudes and behaviors in accordance with identity cues derived from the employed avatar’s appearance, which can persist after leaving virtual reality. Individual reactions to the experience can affect the strength of observed Proteus effects. Especially the experienced illusions of body ownership of avatars and of being in the virtual environment (spatial presence) have been discussed in this context. This study investigated a Proteus effect of avatar age on post-embodiment walking speed, with special focus on how body ownership and spatial presence moderated this effect. Participants who had previously embodied older avatars took significantly longer to walk a set distance than either young avatar or control group participants. This was only apparent during the first half of the walking phase, which may indicate fast decay rates of the effect after embodiment ended. The reported body ownership could not be shown to impact the strength of the Proteus effect. Participants reporting more pronounced spatial presence were subject to stronger Proteus effects, with only the twothirds of the sample with higher spatial presence showing evidence of the effect.},

	abstract = {Today, virtual reality and immersive environments are lines of research which can be applied to numerous scientiﬁc and educational domains. Immersive digital media needs new approaches regarding its interactive and immersive features, which means the design of new narratives and relationships with users. Additionally, {ICT} (information and communication theory) evolves through more immersive and interactive scenarios, it being necessary to design and conceive new forms of representing information and improving users’ interaction with immersive environments. Virtual reality and technologies associated with the virtuality continuum, such as immersive and digital environments, are emerging media. As a medium, this approach may help to build and represent ideas and concepts, as well as developing new languages. This review analyses the cutting-edge expressive, interactive and representative potential of immersive digital technologies. It also considers future possibilities regarding the evolution of these immersive technologies, such as virtual reality, in coming years, in order to apply them to diverse scientiﬁc, artistic or informational and educational domains. We conclude that virtual reality is an ensemble of technological innovations, but also a concept, and propose models to link it with the latest in other domains such as {UX} (user experience), interaction design. This concept can help researchers and developers to design new experiences and conceive new expressive models that can be applied to a wide range of scientiﬁc lines of research and educational dynamics.},

This research investigated if sexist nonverbal behavior of a male instructor could activate stereotype threat among women in a virtual classroom. In addition, the research examined if learners’ avatar representation in virtual reality altered this nonverbal process. Speciﬁcally, a 2 (avatar gender: female vs. male) · 2 (instructor behavior: dominant sexist vs. nondominant or nonsexist) between-subjects experiment was used. Data from 76 female college students demonstrated that participants learned less and performed worse when interacting with a sexist male instructor compared with a nonsexist instructor in a virtual classroom. Participants learned and performed equally well when represented by female and male avatars. Our ﬁndings extend previous research in physical learning settings, suggesting that dominant-sexist behaviors may give rise to stereotype threat and undermine women’s learning outcomes in virtual classrooms. Implications for gender achievement gaps and stereotype threat are discussed.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an experiment that compares behavior in small groups when its members carry out a task in a virtual environment ({VE}) and then continue the same task in a similar, real-world environment. The purpose of the experiment was not to examine task performance, but to compare various aspects of the social relations among the group members in the two environments. Ten groups of three people each, who had never met before, met ﬁrst in a shared {VE} and carried out a task that required the identiﬁcation and solution of puzzles that were presented on pieces of paper displayed around the walls of a room. The puzzle involved identifying that the same-numbered words across all the pieces of paper formed a riddle or saying. The group continued this task for ﬁfteen minutes, and then stopped to answer a questionnaire. The group then reconvened in the real world and continued the same task. The experiment also required one of the group members to continually monitor a particular one of the others in order to examine whether social discomfort could be generated within a {VE}. In each group, there was one immersed person with a headmounted display and head-tracking and two non-immersed people who experienced the environment on a workstation display. The results suggest that the immersed person tended to emerge as the leader in the virtual group, but not in the real meeting. Group accord tended to be higher in the real meeting than in the virtual meeting. Socially conditioned responses such as embarrassment could be generated in the virtual meeting, even though the individuals were presented to one another by very simple avatars. The study also found a positive relationship between presence of being in a place and copresence—the sense of being with the other people. Accord in the group increased with presence, the performance of the group, and the presence of women in the group. The study is seen as part of a much larger planned study, for which this experiment was used to begin to understand the issues involved in comparing real and virtual meetings.},

Each construct was measured at two levels: male and female for avatar gender, young and old for avatar age, commercial transaction and help-supporting for region theme, and high-active and low-active for avatar physical activity. The model was tested on Second Life, one of the most popular virtual worlds. An advanced data collection technique was created and applied to gather large-scale behavior data from real virtual-world residents in Second Life. To test the model and hypotheses, both the main effects and detailed interaction effects of the three factors were analyzed. Overall, the data analysis results indicated that in general male avatars were more physically active than female avatars, young avatars were more physically active than old avatars, and avatars in commercial transaction regions (for buying and selling virtual goods) were more physically active than avatars in help-supporting regions (for seeking or offering help).},

Speciﬁcally, we examine how avatar customization (i.e., designing an avatar) and avatar-body connection (i.e., the perception that the avatar is incorporated into body schema) interact with avatar gender to inﬂuence user’s post-game behavior in ways that conform to gendered stereotypes. In an experimental study (N = 64, all female), participants completed a competitive math task after playing a digital sword-ﬁghting game. For participants who customized an avatar and experienced low avatar embodiment, those who used male avatar performed better at the math task than those who used a female avatar. These ﬁndings extend our understanding of avatar use effects, especially as they relate to avatar self-relevance, avatar customization, avatar embodiment, and stereotype threat, thereby providing insights into the ways that digital games can be designed to maximize positive outcomes for players in a variety of meaningful contexts.},

Results from an experimental study suggest that avatar self-relevance after avatar use, as reflected by physiological responses to observing (without controlling) the avatar get beaten up, is higher for people who maintain a psychological connection to the avatar, while lower for people for whom the disconnection from the avatar is highly salient, with avatar gender consistency and an avatar-emotion connection contributing to the former and an avatar-body connection contributing to the latter.

We examined whether embodying a dissimilar self in {VR} would decrease anxiety in a public speaking situation. We report the results of an observational pilot study and two laboratory experiments. In the pilot study (N = 252), participants chose an avatar to use in a public speaking task. Trait public speaking anxiety correlated with avatar preference, such that anxious individuals preferred dissimilar self-representations. In Study 1 (N = 82), differences in anxiety during a speech in front of a virtual audience were compared among participants embodying an assigned avatar whose face was identical to their real self, an assigned avatar whose face was other than their real face, or embodied an avatar of their choice. Anxiety differences were not signiﬁcant, but there was a trend for lower anxiety with the assigned dissimilar avatar compared to the avatar looking like the real self. Study 2 (N = 105) was designed to explicate that trend, and further investigated anxiety differences with an assigned self or dissimilar avatar. The assigned dissimilar avatar reduced anxiety relative to the assigned self avatar for one measure of anxiety. We discuss implications for theories of self-representation as well as for applied uses of {VR} to treat social anxiety.},

However, there is limited understanding of what factors affect presence in virtual environments. This study uses a qualitative methodology, speciﬁcally thematic analysis, to investigate factors affecting sense of presence in a {VR} social environment that has been designed for psychological assessment. After experiencing a virtual bar-room that contained interactions with multiple avatars, participants (n = 76) took part in a semistructured interview. Eight key themes and associated subthemes were identiﬁed: emotions about self (anxiety, paranoid ideation, and detachment), emotions about others (loneliness, retrospective emotions, and recognition of self), thoughts about self (memories and social judgment), thoughts about others (paranoid ideation and narrative), physiological reactions (anxiety and cybersickness), behavior of avatars (narrative, duration of interaction, and characteristics), interactivity with environment (movement and familiarity), and environmental characteristics (restrictions). Sense of presence was facilitated when the {VR} elicited genuine cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses, and when participants created their own narrative about events. Presence decreased when participants experienced diminished agency and experienced physical impediments, such as cybersickness and awareness of apparatus and body movement. Strengths of the study include rich data generated by the qualitative approach and the large sample size. Limitations include lack of follow-up measuring longer-term effects.},

In 3 experiments, African American professionals were attuned to minority representation and diversity philosophy cues when they were presented as a part of workplace settings. Low minority representation cues coupled with colorblindness (as opposed to valuing diversity) led African American professionals to perceive threatening identity contingencies and to distrust the setting (Experiment 1). The authors then verified that the mechanism mediating the effect of setting cues on trust was identity contingent evaluations (Experiments 2 \& 3). The power of social identity contingencies as they relate to underrepresented groups in mainstream institutions is discussed.},

Meanwhile, {ODT} indicates that too much visual similarity rather concerns individuals about their deprived uniqueness, so they would be reluctant to conform to a majority opinion as a way to restore their uniqueness. This study concurs with previous research based on {SIDE} by showing that group identiﬁcation induced by uniform appearance increases conformity intention. It also showed that perceived deindividuation, another variable that is induced by a high level of visual similarity relative to others, decreases conformity intention. As a result, the current study shows that the effect of virtual uniform appearance on conformity intention is inconsistently mediated by group identiﬁcation and perceived deindividuation.},

In Experiment 2, unacquainted mixed-sex dyads participated in a series of either humorous or similar but non-humorous tasks. In both studies, humor was positively associated with liking and closeness; perceived reciprocal liking and enjoyment of the interaction mediated the association between humor and liking. Likewise, we found a positive association between liking and humor. Men and women did not differ in self-reported humor use.

It has been argued that, for this reason, individuals prefer to associate with others who share their culture, and also that shared appreciation of humor provides a particularly effective means of identifying others with the relevant preferences and knowledge. The present experiment uses a ‘dummy rating procedure’ to compare the effects of sharing an appreciation of non-humorous (first lines of novels) and humorous (jokes) cultural stimuli on interpersonal affiliation, altruism and assessment. The results show that the degree of shared appreciation for both sets of stimuli had a positive effect on Affiliation; only humorous stimuli had an effect on Altruism; and neither effected the Assessment of others' personal traits. Thus, the results support the general theory that shared culture promotes affiliation, and provide evidence of the special role of humor in interpersonal relations.},

Follow-up interviews with five {NSs} were conducted (mean = 16.6 minutes; {SD} = 3.54). We used Interactional Sociolinguistics to identify four types of {NSs}’ reactions when {NNSs}’ cover strategies or lack of understanding become noticeable: (1) collaborating and finding commonalities; (2) interpersonal distancing through {NSs}’ repairs; (3) othering of {NNSs}; and (4) engaging in patronizing talk. Our findings highlight that cover strategies can result in problematic consequences even when they were initially successful: {NSs}’ accommodations are not always helpful in reducing possible miscommunication or in developing relationships. {NS}–{NNS} power differences are negotiated, resisted, and challenged through interactions.},

Sixteen dyads (N = 32) consisting of nonnative speakers ({NNSs}) and native speakers ({NSs}) of English performed 2 different tasks using videoconferenc- ing and written chat. The data were coded and analyzed both for instances of negotiation of meaning and for instances where the {NNSs} did not initiate repair despite nonunderstanding. Absences of negotia- tion of meaning are generally excluded from detailed analysis primarily because it is difficult to establish nonunderstanding unless the participant overtly indicates it. In order to assess the effect of the nonoc- currence of negotiation of meaning on task performance and task completion, this study used 2 tasks: a culturally specific task that almost certainly would result in {NNS} nonunderstanding and a collaborative decision-making task that should trigger instances of negotiation of meaning. It was found that, in both tasks, instead of initiating repair sequences, {NNS} participants frequently did not engage in negotiation of meaning despite nonunderstanding. We conclude that disregarding nonoccurrence of negotiation of meaning in (digital) task-based language teaching may lead to misrepresenting task performance, task outcome, and task evaluation, and, beyond that, to disregarding evidence that has both empirical and theoretical consequences for the Interaction Hypothesis and, by implication, for second language acquisition.},

Gender valences of these findings are briefly discussed. It is suggested that these differences in using humor may be due to the minority status of the Maori in the New Zealand society. It is concluded that, if the Maori \& Pakeha use humor differently, then there is considerable scope for miscommunication, thus leaving the Maori little choice but to assimilate to Pakeha lifestyle, beliefs, \& values. 1 Appendix, 56 References.

This study is based on a yearlong ethnography of a hotel kitchen that focuses on the in-group humor of chefs as they work. It reveals the chefs' humor as a communicative process that establishes the group's boundaries, the identity of the group members, and the processes through which the group makes sense of and performs its labor. Humor's role within this organizational group is demonstrated through situated episodes that not only (re)produce the status quo, but also provides a strategy for employees to subvert or challenge authoritative power and constraining organizing practices. © 2010 Walter de Gruyter {GmbH} \& Co. {KG}, Berlin/New York.},

In the data presented here, a divergence in social norms is in one extract made salient as a point of difference among interlocutors, and in two other examples a potential divergence in social norms is treated as if it were the case but not confirmed. These instances are dealt with through laughables and laughter sequences. Sequential analysis of these naturally occurring audio-recorded conversations indicate that participants make salient and orient to what is in their experience deviant from their learned norms and expectations of behaviour without consistently exhibiting affiliative interactional and relational work throughout the interactions. The result of this study has important implications to the way in which {ELF} interactions can be interpreted and described going forward.},

It explores the structures and dynamics of conflict talk, showing how participants contextualize their interaction as conflict. Then it explores various types of humor and their effects on conflict sequences. In particular, it demonstrates: (1) how humor can successfully end conflict; (2) how one participant can for a time ignore/reject attempts at humor by others; (3) how humor can forestall an impending conflict, but fail to end it; (4) how two parties in conflict talk can ignore attempts at humor by a third, unratified party; (5) how laughter can help resolve conflict even in the absence of humor; and (6) how a humorous key can prevent conflict from arising in potentially contentious contexts. Further, it demonstrates that the effectiveness of humor depends on a series of factors: first, the seriousness of the conflict, second, the social power relationship between the participants, third, the kind of humor, fourth, the reactions of the participants, and finally, who initiates the humor.},

Thus far, much design of autonomous systems takes a Western view valuing individual preferences and choice. We challenge the assumption that Western values are universally optimal for robots. In this study, we sought to clarify the effects of users’ cultural background on human–robot collaboration by investigating their attitudes toward and the extent to which people accepted choices made by a robot or human assistant. A 2×2×2 experiment was conducted with nationality ({US} vs. Chinese), ingroup strength (weak vs. strong) and human vs. robot assistant as dimensions. {US} participants reported higher trust of and compliance with the assistants (human and robot) although when the assistant was characterized as a strong ingroup member, Chinese as compared with the {US} subjects were more comfortable. Chinese also reported a stronger sense of control with both assistants and were more likely to anthropomorphize the robot than were {US} subjects. This pattern of findings confirms that people from different national cultures may respond differently to robots, but also suggests that predictions from human-human interaction do not hold universally.},

This study introduces the linguistic style matching ({LSM}) algorithm for calculating verbal mimicry based on an automated textual analysis of function words. The {LSM} algorithm was applied to language generated during a small group discussion in which 70 groups comprised of 324 individuals engaged in an information search task either face-to-face or via text-based computer-mediated communication. As a metric, {LSM} predicted the cohesiveness of groups in both communication environments, and it predicted task performance in face-to-face groups. Other language features were also related to the groups’ cohesiveness and performance, including word count, pronoun patterns, and verb tense. The results reveal that this type of automated measure of verbal mimicry can be an objective, efficient, and unobtrusive tool for predicting underlying social dynamics. In total, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of using language to predict change in social psychological factors of interest.},

To explore the trends in this new body of literature, we conducted a meta-analysis of 116 empirical studies of intragroup conflict (n ϭ 8,880 groups) and its relationship with group outcomes. To address the heterogeneity across the studies included in the meta-analysis, we also investigated a number of moderating variables. Stable negative relationships were found between relationship and process conflict and group outcomes. In contrast to the results of De Dreu and Weingart, we did not find a strong and negative association between task conflict and group performance. Analyses of main effects as well as moderator analyses revealed a more complex picture. Task conflict and group performance were more positively related among studies where the association between task and relationship conflict was relatively weak, in studies conducted among top management teams rather than non–top management teams, and in studies where performance was measured in terms of financial performance or decision quality rather than overall performance.},

The authors suggest a conceptual model to account for these findings, arguing that the happiness–success link exists not only because success makes people happy, but also because positive affect engenders success. Three classes of evidence— crosssectional, longitudinal, and experimental—are documented to test their model. Relevant studies are described and their effect sizes combined meta-analytically. The results reveal that happiness is associated with and precedes numerous successful outcomes, as well as behaviors paralleling success. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that positive affect—the hallmark of well-being—may be the cause of many of the desirable characteristics, resources, and successes correlated with happiness. Limitations, empirical issues, and important future research questions are discussed.},

The ﬁndings of the study show that humour is present in all meetings but the frequency and tone of the humour varies with the style of the meetings. Indeed shifts in style between formality and informality are a common feature of the meetings and humour is one of several interactive strategies which cluster together to mark these shifts towards greater informality. It appears that these style shifts and the humour within them can be used strategically to show solidarity and power, particularly by the dominant ‘in-group’ of western, male participants. It is suggested that, in these meetings, humour acts as a ‘double-edged sword’ being used to both positive and negative effect: facilitating, on the one hand, collaboration and inclusion and, on the other, collusion and exclusion.},

Drawing on theories of humor and emotion, the Wheel Model suggests that humor-induced positive affect results in transmission of emotion to social groups, which in turn creates a climate that supports humor use and subsequent humor events. This model is depicted in a circular pattern to highlight the cumulative and escalatory process through which individual humor events can impact individuals and groups over repeated cycles of the wheel. We also describe individual and environmental variables that are likely to have an impact on relationships within the Wheel Model. Finally, we discuss specific research contexts to which the Wheel Model can be applied (mentoring, leadership, groups/teams), as well as other future research directions.},

Informants identiﬁed their style of humor as ‘‘taking the piss,’’ a colloquial term meaning to use jocular abuse to deﬂate someone else’s ego to bring them to the same level as others. The {IT} organizations studied were young, creative and energetic and the banter was lively and almost always enjoyed. Six main functions of banter were identiﬁed: making a point, boredom busting, socialization, celebrating di¤erences, displaying the culture, and highlighting and deﬁning status. Banter occurred more readily when it involved popular and well-liked colleagues that were fully socialized into the organizational culture. Personal characteristics and traits — such as ethnicity, gender, age, height or dress style — were the target of much banter. Much of the literature discussing banter has focused on the negative e¤ects of jocular abuse at work. This paper emphasises how banter helped facilitate functioning cultural systems in the organizations studied. However, for those not socialized through the banter into the in-group, banter was often experienced as painful, exclusionary and even insulting.},

	abstract = {Teasing has often been linked with studies of face, with many analysts claiming that it can be interpreted as face-threatening and/or face-supportive depending on the context. Since teasing encompasses such a diverse and heterogeneous range of actions in interaction, however, the analysis of teasing in this paper is restricted to a particular type of teasing, namely, jocular mockery. After exploring how jocular mockery is interactionally achieved as an action, the ways in which participants align or disalign their responses to previous actions through jocular mockery, thereby indexing afﬁliative or disafﬁliative stances with other participants is discussed. Building on this initial analysis, it is proposed that an approach to pragmatics informed by the results and methods of conversation analysis can usefully ground an exploration of the ways in which jocular mockery inﬂuences the participants’ interpretings of their evolving relationships, here glossed as face consistent with its conceptualisation in Arundale’s (1999, 2006, this issue) Face Constituting Theory. It is argued that an approach to jocular mockery which explicates its impact on the evolving relationship between the interactants gives a richer account than that concerned only with the personal identity, public image or the wants of individuals, as face has traditionally been understood.},

Elements of the joking culture serve to smooth group interaction, share a‰liation, separate the group from outsiders, and secure the compliance of group members through social control. To demonstrate these processes we rely upon two detailed ethnographic examples of continuing joking: one from mushroom collectors and the second from professional meteorologists.},

Over several decades Alan Davies challenged the concept on account of the barrier it poses for language learners, who can never achieve native speakerhood on account of factors of birth and upbringing that result in unacceptable discrimination and limited opportunities that are not tolerated in most aspects of citizenship or employment, but have managed to persist where language is concerned. Yet native and non-native speakerhood is a genuine part of our experience and perception, which it seems illusory to deny on account of its unpalatable political consequences. This article reconsiders the concept of native speaker in the light of current theories of extended and distributed cognition, which allow us to redeﬁne it in corporeal and intrapersonal terms, rescuing its liberating aspects, which have not been negligible, while providing a sustainable basis for rejecting it in those contexts where it is oppressive.},

It begins with a semantic inquiry into the word ‘laugh’, a plausible lexical universal and an essential anchor point for humour studies. It then demonstrates how the two main modes of ethnopragmatic analysis, semantic explication and cultural scripts, can be applied to selected topics in conversational humour research. Semantic explications are proposed for three English speciﬁc “humour concepts”: ‘funny’, ‘amusing’, and ‘humour’. Cultural scripts are proposed for “jocular abuse”, “deadpan jocular irony” and “jocular deception” in Australian English. The semantic explications and cultural scripts are composed using simple, cross-translatable words.},

What differentiates such group-level emotions from emotions that occur purely at the individual level? The authors argue that 4 key criteria define group-level emotions: Group emotions are distinct from the same person’s individual-level emotions, depend on the person’s degree of group identification, are socially shared within a group, and contribute to regulating intragroup and intergroup attitudes and behavior. Evidence from 2 studies supports all 4 of these predictions and thus points to the meaningfulness, coherence, and functionality of group-level emotions.},

	abstract = {Extant research suggests that targets’ emotion expressions automatically evoke similar affect in perceivers. The authors hypothesized that the automatic impact of emotion expressions depends on group membership. In Experiments 1 and 2, an affective priming paradigm was used to measure immediate and preconscious affective responses to same-race or other-race emotion expressions. In Experiment 3, spontaneous vocal affect was measured as participants described the emotions of an ingroup or outgroup sports team fan. In these experiments, immediate and spontaneous affective responses depended on whether the emotional target was ingroup or outgroup. Positive responses to fear expressions and negative responses to joy expressions were observed in outgroup perceivers, relative to ingroup perceivers. In Experiments 4 and 5, discrete emotional responses were examined. In a lexical decision task (Experiment 4), facial expressions of joy elicited fear in outgroup perceivers, relative to ingroup perceivers. In contrast, facial expressions of fear elicited less fear in outgroup than in ingroup perceivers. In Experiment 5, felt dominance mediated emotional responses to ingroup and outgroup vocal emotion. These data support a signal-value model in which emotion expressions signal environmental conditions.},

Humour may be used to create ambiguity or to promote closure: its impact oo the organizational culture will depend on the extent to which the symbolic transformations achieved within its boundaries can be transposed into material, 'real-world' relationships.},

The results from Experiment 1 showed S1 priming eﬀects at the initial and intermediary time point. Priming for S2 also emerged at the intermediary time point and persisted at the ﬁnal time point. In Experiment 2, the priming eﬀect at joke oﬀset was reliable only for S2. The results are taken to support a concurrent meaning activation view [in line with Attardo, Humor 10 (1997) 395] at incongruity detection, and a selective activation view [in line with Giora, Journal of Pragmatics 16 (1991) 465] at incongruity resolution.},

A closer look at how laughter and humor developed in our hominid ancestors can deepen our understanding of interpersonal humor effects—laughter is an acoustic signal that the environment is safe and helps positive affect to spread among group members. Current research based on evolutionary theory investigates the spread of positive affect in work teams, the size of natural laughter groups and fake laughter. A micro-level look at speciﬁc humorous comments reﬂects the duality of humor as well. We close with a note of caution, future research ideas, and implications.},

First, the authors summarize several challenges researchers face in deﬁning and operationalizing humor, and offer an integrative conceptualization which may be used to consolidate and interpret seemingly disparate research streams. Second, meta-analysis is used to explore the possibility that positive humor is associated with: employee health (e.g. burnout, health) and work-related outcomes (e.g. performance, job satisfaction, withdrawal); with perceived supervisor/leader effectiveness (e.g. perceived leader performance, follower approval); and may mitigate the deleterious effects of workplace stress on employee burnout.},

Although recent studies have revealed that humor acts as an intrinsic reward, which explains why people actively seek to experience and create humor, few have addressed the cognitive aspects of humor. We used eventrelated functional magnetic resonance imaging to differentiate brain activity induced by the hedonic similarities and cognitive differences inherent in 2 kinds of humor: visual humor (sight gags) and languagebased humor. Our ﬁndings indicate that the brain networks recruited during a humorous experience differ according to the type of humor being processed, with high-level visual areas activated during visual humor and classic language areas activated during language-dependent humor. Our results additionally highlight a common network activated by both types of humor that includes the amygdalar and midbrain regions, which presumably reﬂect the euphoric component of humor. Furthermore, we found that humor activates anterior cingulate cortex and frontoinsular cortex, 2 regions in the brain that are known to have phylogenetically recent neuronal circuitry. These results suggest that humor may have coevolved with another cognitive specialization of the great apes and humans: the ability to navigate through a shifting and complex social space.},

Results show that all three types of stimuli evoked blood–oxygen-level-dependent responses along the left and right peri-sylvian cortex. However, we observed differences in regional strength and lateralization in that (i) hearing human laughter preferentially involves auditory and somatosensory fields primarily in the right hemisphere, (ii) hearing spoken sentences activates left anterior and posterior lateral temporal regions, (iii) hearing nonvocal sounds recruits bilateral areas in the medial portion of Heschl’s gyrus and at the medial wall of the posterior Sylvian Fissure (planum parietale and parietal operculum). Generally, the data imply a differential regional sensitivity of peri-sylvian areas to different auditory stimuli with the left hemisphere responding more strongly to speech and with the right hemisphere being more amenable to nonspeech stimuli. Interestingly, passive perception of human laughter activates brain regions which control motor (larynx) functions. This observation may speak to the issue of a dense intertwining of expressive and receptive mechanisms in the auditory domain. Furthermore, the present study provides evidence for a functional role of inferior parietal areas in auditory processing. Finally, a post hoc conjunction analysis meant to reveal the neural substrates of human vocal timbre demonstrates a particular preference of left and right lateral parts of the superior temporal lobes for stimuli which are made up of human voices relative to nonvocal sounds.},

Recently, neuroimaging has been applied to this critical human attribute, shedding light on the affective, cognitive, and motor networks involved in humor processing. To date, however, researchers have failed to demonstrate the subcortical correlates of the most fundamental feature of humor—reward. In an effort to elucidate the neurobiological substrate that subserves the reward components of humor, we undertook a high-field (3 Tesla) event-related functional {MRI} study. Here we demonstrate that humor modulates activity in several cortical regions, and we present new evidence that humor engages a network of subcortical regions including the nucleus accumbens, a key component of the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward system. Further, the degree of humor intensity was positively correlated with {BOLD} signal intensity in these regions. Together, these findings offer new insight into the neural basis of salutary aspects of humor.},

	volume = {27},
	abstract = {Nonlinguistic communication is typically proposed to convey representational messages, implying that particular signals are associated with specific signaler emotions, intentions, or external referents. However, common signals produced by both nonhuman primates and humans may not exhibit such specificity, with human laughter for example showing significant diversity in both acoustic form and production context. We therefore outline an alternative to the representational approach, arguing that laughter and other nonlinguistic vocalizations are used to influence the affective states of listeners, thereby also affecting their behavior. In the case of laughter, we propose a primary function of accentuating or inducing positive affect in the perceiver in order to promote a more favorable stance toward the laugher. Two simple strategies are identified, namely producing laughter with acoustic features that have an immediate impact on listener arousal, and pairing these sounds with positive affect in the listener to create learned affective responses. Both depend on factors like the listener’s current emotional state and past interactions with the vocalizer, with laughers predicted to adjust their sounds accordingly. This approach is used to explain findings from two experimental studies that examined the use of laughter in same-sex and different-sex dyads composed of either friends or strangers, and may be applicable to other forms of nonlinguistic communication.},

We propose that organizational dyads and groups inhabit emotion cycles: Emotions of an individual inﬂuence the emotions, thoughts and behaviors of others; others’ reactions can then inﬂuence their future interactions with the individual expressing the original emotion, as well as that individual’s future emotions and behaviors. People can mimic the emotions of others, thereby extending the social presence of a speciﬁc emotion, but can also respond to others’ emotions, extending the range of emotions present. People can also draw attributions and extract meanings from others’ emotions. Emotion cycles can involve both intended targets of or partners to an original emotion and third parties who were not the intended targets or partners. Emotion cycles are sensitive to various moderating factors, including demographic variables (e.g., gender or race) and situational variables (e.g., relative power of participants). Pertinent organizational and psychological research that supports the idea of emotion cycles is reviewed and shown to suggest a wide arena for future research.},

Perhaps constrained by rationalist assumptions and conceptions of work and organization as domains of the serious, humor in organizations has received relatively little attention in management and organization studies. Such relative neglect notwithstanding, there has been a steady stream of work over the last 50 years, increasing somewhat latterly. The paper reflects, firstly, on this neglect in the face of the pervasiveness and significance of humor in life and in organizations. Next it considers more orthodox, functionalist research on humor in organizations, noting that this is the dominant stream of work. Whilst of value, this work offers a limited and partial perspective: we therefore address alternative, non-functionalist approaches that have emerged latterly, some of which take us towards a more radical view of humor in the workplace as resistance and subversion. This work is a caution against adopting a narrow functionalist view of humor and its appropriation for a managerialist agenda. In this critical evaluation of the literature humor is shown to be heterogeneous, both in its forms and effects and there is a need of better theorization that acknowledges that and which properly contextualizes humor in relation to the specific dynamics and complexities of work and organizations.},

As predicted by several humor theorists, results showed that more humorous individuals changed their perspective more often for stressful events, and found such changes to be beneficial. Participants in the second study provided cognitive appraisals both before and after completing two drawing tasks. Higher levels of humor were associated with more positive challenge appraisals for both drawing tasks, and lower threat appraisals prior to the first task. In further accord with a positive enhancement effect for humor, this study also found that higher levels of task motivation and positive affect were evident for those individuals with a greater sense of humor. The findings from Study 2 also provided empirical support for several of the basic underlying relationships that are fundamental to cognitive appraisal theory. Discussion focused on the enhancing effects of sense of humor, along with a need to further integrate individual difference research with cognitive appraisal theory. It was also recommended that future research focus more specifically on the multidimensional aspects of sense of humor. These aspects should then be considered relative to other more general personality constructs, such as extraversion and emotionality.},

	abstract = {In this study, persuasion theory was used to develop the following predictions about use of humor in persuasive messages for business ethics training: (a) cartoon drawings will enhance persuasion by creating liking for the source, (b) ironic wisecracks will enhance persuasion by serving as a distraction from counterarguments, and (c) selfeffacing humor will enhance persuasion by improving source credibility. Canadian business students (N= 148) participated in 1of 4 versions of “The Ethics Challenge,” a training exercise used by the Lockheed Martin Corporation. Three versions were modified by adding or removing cartoon drawings (of cartoon characters Dilbert and Dogbert) and humorous responses (Dogbert’s wisecracks). Removing the cartoon drawings had little effect on persuasiveness. Removing ironic wisecracks had more effect, and interfering with the self-effacing combination of cartoons and wisecracks had the strongest effect. The results suggest that researchers should ground their predictions in existing theory and that practitioners should differentiate among humor types.},

Undergraduate students (N=258) from introductory psychology courses completed a perceived stress scale, an everyday problems scale, a state anxiety inventory, a sense of humor scale, and a scale assessing their preferred coping strategies. High and low sense of humor groups were determined by selecting participants with self-reported sense of humor at one standard deviation above and below the overall mean on the sense of humor scale. The high sense of humor group appraised less stress and reported less current anxiety than a low sense of humor group despite experiencing a similar number of everyday problems in the previous two months. The high humor group was more likely to use positive reappraisal and problem-solving coping strategies than the low humor group. A weaker relationship existed between appraisal of stress and number of problems in the low humor group because this group perceived greater stress at low and average number of everyday problems than the high humor group. The results were discussed as supporting the role of humor in restructuring a situation so it is less stressful, and the relationship of humor to both emotion-focused and problem-focused coping strategies.},

These are: relatively benign uses of humor to enhance the self (Self-enhancing) and to enhance {oneÕs} relationships with others (Aﬃliative), use of humor to enhance the self at the expense of others (Aggressive), and use of humor to enhance relationships at the expense of self (Self-defeating). Validation data indicate that the four scales diﬀerentially relate in predicted ways to peer ratings of humor styles and to measures of mood (cheerfulness, depression, anxiety, hostility), self-esteem, optimism, well-being, intimacy, and social support. They also relate to all ﬁve dimensions of the Five Factor Model and to Agency and Communion. The ﬁrst two scales overlap with previous humor tests, whereas the Aggressive and Self-defeating humor scales largely tap diﬀerent dimensions. Males scored higher than females on Aggressive and Self-defeating humor. It is expected that the {HSQ} will be useful for research on humor and psychological well-being by assessing forms of humor that may be deleterious to health as well as those that are beneﬁcial.},

Using videotaped data of crosscultural conversation groups, and employing a close linguistic analysis based in Gumperz’s theory of conversational inference, this paper documents the ability of beginning language learners to collaborate in the construction of conversational joking discourse with native English speakers. The claim is made that communication is achieved indirectly within these jointly-constructed joking episodes through displaying understanding by playing within the frame set out by the other. Such ﬁnetuning of understanding is the core of why the ability to participate in such joking is important in the development of rapport. Illustrative joking episodes represent diﬀerences along several dimensions: the exploitation of limited sociolinguistic resources, with examples of primary reliance on the nonverbal and lexical, on the prosodic, and on the pragmatic; the interactional roles of the native English speaker and learner(s), with examples of diﬀerent patterns of initiation and collaboration; and the focus of the joking within the general theme of the learners’ perspective on the language learning experience, in eﬀect, the culture of the language learner, with examples highlighting the apparently arbitrary nature of idiomatic expressions, the diﬃculty of coping with interaction in the new language, and the general powerlessness of the language learner in a world of native speakers.},

Emotions are construed as interpretations of physiological response to important social events with these interpretations guiding behavior. Concerning interpretation, the dimensions used by Chinese to understand emotion-eliciting events are the same as those found in many other cultures. Which sorts of events are keyed to these dimensions appear to differ, however, in ways consistent with theorizing about power distance and collectivism. Concerning physiological reactions, there appears again to be evidence for universality in the pattern of response for given emotions. What differs in Chinese culture is the lower frequency, intensity and duration with which emotions are typically experienced. Cultural beliefs about emotions support this general moderation and have implications for conceptions of psychopathology. Concerning the action component of emotions, evidence suggests that the expression of emotion is carefully regulated out of concern for its capacity to disrupt group harmony and status hierarchies. It is concluded that all these features of Chinese emotional responding are likely to be found in other groups that share cultural characteristics with the Chinese.},

Gender is conceived as a system of meanings that inﬂuences access to power, status, and material resources. Humor is conceived as a mode of discourse and a strategy for social interaction. Within this theoretical framework, it is argued that women and men use humor in same-gender and mixed-gender settings as one of the tools of gender construction. Through it and other means, they constitute themselves as masculine men and feminine women. At the same time, the unique properties of humor make it a valuable tool of gender deconstruction. In the political humor of the women’s movement, and in the conversational humor of women friends, resistance to dominant social constructions of gender can be voiced.},

One of the leading theories advocated for conﬂict resolution and prevention is the Contact Hypothesis (Allport, 1954). According to this theory, contact under certain conditions will create a positive intergroup encounter, which in turn, will reduce prejudice and discrimination, and bring about an improvement in intergroup relations. Although the Internet has become an accessible and pivotal medium of communication there are surprisingly few projects that make use of its potential for bridging between groups in conﬂict. This article explains how the Internet’s unique qualities may help overcome the major obstacles inherent in the Contact Hypothesis. In doing so, it differentiates between structured and unstructured online intergroup contact, and provides an analysis of some of the leading online intergroup contact platforms, both past and present.

A virtual human representing an outgroup member (a Palestinian) interacted with 60 Jewish Israeli participants in an experimental study. We manipulated postural mimicry by the virtual interaction partner during a conversation about a sensitive conﬂict issue. Mimicry increased empathy toward the Palestinians, irrespective of participants’ feelings toward the Palestinians prior to the experiment. Further, mimicked participants who reported a priori negative feelings toward Palestinians expressed more sympathy toward their Palestinian virtual interaction partner, rated themselves as closer to him, and perceived the interaction as more harmonious compared to participants in a counter-mimicry condition. The results underscore the impact of mimicry on intergroup interactions, especially on individuals who harbor negative feelings toward the outgroup. The use of virtual–human interactions in obtaining this effect reveals the still widely unexplored potential of technology-enhanced conﬂict resolution.},

	abstract = {People generally show greater preference for members of their own racial group compared to racial out-group members. This type of ‘in-group bias’ is evident in mimicry behaviors. We tend to automatically mimic the behaviors of in-group members, and this behavior is associated with interpersonal sensitivity and empathy. However, mimicry is reduced when interacting with out-group members. Although race is considered an unchangeable trait, it is possible using embodiment in immersive virtual reality to engender the illusion in people of having a body of a different race. Previous research has used this technique to show that after a short period of embodiment of White people in a Black virtual body their implicit racial bias against Black people diminishes. Here we show that this technique powerfully enhances mimicry. We carried out an experiment with 32 White (Caucasian) female participants. Half were embodied in a White virtual body and the remainder in a Black virtual body. Each interacted in two different sessions with a White and a Black virtual character, in counterbalanced order. The results show that dyads with the same virtual body skin color expressed greater mimicry than those of different color. Importantly, this effect occurred depending on the virtual body’s race, not participants’ actual racial group. When embodied in a Black virtual body, White participants treat Black as their novel in-group and Whites become their novel out-group. This reversed in-group bias effect was obtained regardless of participants’ level of implicit racial bias. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this surprising psychological phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophers took interest in humour and, in particular, humorous incongruities. Humour was not necessarily their main interest; however, observations on humour could support their more general philosophical theories. Spontaneous and unintentional humour such as anecdotes, witty remarks and absurd events were the styles of humour that they analysed and made part of their theories. Prepared humour such as verbal jokes were rarely included in their observations, likely dismissed as too vulgar and not requiring intellectual effort. Humour, as analysed by several eighteenth and nineteenth century philosophers, was seen as part of daily life or life simulated on stage. In the twentieth century, Freud emphasized a possible ‘relief’ function of ‘prepared’ humour such as jokes. Additionally, linguists began developing theories to analyse jokes. A joke has a particular structure that is constructed with the aim of achieving a humorous effect. This structure makes jokes suitable for linguistic analysis. In the present-day humour research, jokes have become a main topic of research. This linguistically oriented joke research neglects many other forms of humour: spontaneous humour, non-verbal humour, physical humour, and many forms of unintentional humour that appear in real life. We want to survey and re-evaluate the contributions to the humour research of these eighteenth, nineteenth and early twentieth century philosophers and clarify that their more general contributions to the humour research have been neglected in favour of the very restricted form of prepared humour and linguistically expressed and analysed humour as it appears in jokes. We hope that the views expressed in this paper will help to steer the humour research away from joke research and help to integrate humour in the design of human-computer interfaces and smart environments. That is, rather than considering only verbal jokes, we should aim at generating smart environments that understand, facilitate or create humour that goes beyond jokes.},

Through an online survey, we solicit people's interpretations of a sample of the most popular emoji characters, each rendered for multiple platforms. Both in terms of sentiment and semantics, we analyze the variance in interpretation of the emoji, quantifying which emoji are most (and least) likely to be misinterpreted. In cases in which participants rated the same emoji rendering, they disagreed on whether the sentiment was positive, neutral, or negative 25\% of the time. When considering renderings across platforms, these disagreements only increase.

We present an analysis on how smartphone users use emojis based on a very large data set collected from a popular emoji keyboard. The data set contains a complete month of emoji usage of 3.88 million active users from 212 countries and regions. We demonstrate that the categories and frequencies of emojis used by these users provide rich signals for the identification and the understanding of cultural differences of smartphone users.

They are therefore regarded as one of the most important signals for microblog sentiment analysis. Most existing studies use several emoticons that convey clear emotional meanings as noisy sentiment labels or similar sentiment indicators. However, in practical microblog environments, tens or even hundreds of emoticons are frequently adopted and all emoticons have their own unique emotional meanings. Besides, a considerable number of emoticons do not have clear emotional meanings. An improved sentiment analysis model should not overlook these phenomena. Instead of manually assigning sentiment labels to several emoticons that convey relatively clear meanings, we propose the emoticon space model ({ESM}) that leverages more emoticons to construct word representations from a massive amount of unlabeled data. By projecting words and microblog posts into an emoticon space, the proposed model helps identify subjectivity, polarity, and emotion in microblog environments. The experimental results for a public microblog benchmark corpus ({NLP}\&{CC} 2013) indicate that {ESM} effectively leverages emoticon signals and outperforms previous state-of-the-art strategies and benchmark best runs.},

Specifically, we propose the following: (1) compilation of a sentiment lexicon and an emoticon lexicon; (2) emoti-con roles can be classified into four types showing " Empha-sis " , " Assuagement " , " Conversion " , and " Addition " , with roles determined based on a relation between sentiments of sentences and emoticons; and (3) the relation can be for-malized using regression analysis in all roles excepting for " Addition " .},

	abstract = {Recent decades have witnessed online social media being a big-data window for quantificationally testifying conventional social theories and exploring much detailed human behavioral patterns. In this paper, by tracing the emoticon use in Weibo, a group of hidden "ambivalent users" are disclosed for frequently posting ambivalent tweets containing both positive and negative emotions. Further investigation reveals that this ambivalent expression could be a novel indicator of many unusual social behaviors. For instance, ambivalent users with the female as the majority like to make a sound in midnights or at weekends. They mention their close friends frequently in ambivalent tweets, which attract more replies and thus serve as a more private communication way. Ambivalent users also respond differently to public affairs from others and demonstrate more interests in entertainment and sports events. Moreover, the sentiment shift of words adopted in ambivalent tweets is more evident than usual and exhibits a clear "negative to positive" pattern. The above observations, though being promiscuous seemingly, actually point to the self regulation of negative mood in Weibo, which could find its base from the emotion management theories in sociology but makes an interesting extension to the online environment. Finally, as an interesting corollary, ambivalent users are found connected with compulsive buyers and turn out to be perfect targets for online marketing.},

The current research contributes to this activity by building new insights regarding consumers' spontaneous expressions of food-related emotional experiences. This was done by analysing 12,260 tweets about breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner eating situations, previously retrieved by Vidal et al. (2015). A descriptive approach was adopted, wherein focus was direct to capturing frequency and diversity of emoticon and emoji use. It was found that consumers express a wide range of positive and negative emotions and that emoticon and emoji use is tailored to the content of the tweets. Emoji were used more frequently than emoticons to express emotions. While it was rare for tweets to include more than one emoticon or emoji, their use was almost exclusively in addition to other content of the tweet. Our results suggest that emoji and emoticon seem to be an easy and intuitive way to express emotions in a food context. This could represent an opportunity for development of non-verbal subjective methods to measure food-related emotions.},

We evaluate our approach on 2,080 Dutch tweets and forum messages, which all contain emoticons and have been manually annotated for sentiment. On this corpus, paragraph-level accounting for sentiment implied by emoticons significantly improves sentiment classification accuracy. This indicates that whenever emoticons are used, their associated sentiment dominates the sentiment conveyed by textual cues and forms a good proxy for intended sentiment.},

However, a tweet {inWeibo} is extremely short and the words it contains evolve extraordinarily fast. Moreover, the Chinese corpus of sentiments is still very small, which prevents the conventional keyword-based methods from being used. In light of this, we build a system called {MoodLens},which to our best knowledge is the first system for sentiment analysis of Chinese tweets {inWeibo}. In {MoodLens},95 emoticons are mapped into four categories of sentiments, i.e. angry, disgusting, joyful,and sad,which serve as the class labels of tweets. We then collect over 3.5 million labeled tweets as the corpus and train a fast Naïve Bayes classifier, with an empirical precision of 64.3\%. {MoodLens} also implements an incremental learning method to tackle the problem of the sentiment shift and the generation of new words. Using {MoodLens} for real-time tweets obtained from Weibo, several interesting temporal and spatial patterns are observed. Also, sentiment variations are well-captured by {MoodLens} to effectively detect abnormal events in China. Finally, by using the highly efficient Naïve Bayes classifier, {MoodLens} is capable of online real-time sentiment monitoring. The demo of {MoodLens} can be found at http://goo.gl/8DQ65.},

An experiment used an online economic game to obtain pretest and posttest measures of trust. In between these measures, participants played a dance video game on Xbox Kinect. They were randomly assigned to either an ingroup or outgroup agent (black or white) partner. Game score served as a continuous measure of synchrony with the agent. Regression analysis revealed that agent race moderated synchrony’s effect on change in outgroup trust. Increased synchrony with an outgroup agent led to increased outgroup trust. Conversely, increased synchrony with an ingroup agent led to decreased outgroup trust.

This can occur even when the virtual body is quite different in appearance from the person’s real body. However, investigation of the psychological, behavioral and attitudinal consequences of such body transformations remains an interesting problem with much to be discovered. Thirty six Caucasian people participated in a between-groups experiment where they played a West-African Djembe hand drum while immersed in {IVR} and with a virtual body that substituted their own. The virtual hand drum was registered with a physical drum. They were alongside a virtual character that played a drum in a supporting, accompanying role. In a baseline condition participants were represented only by plainly shaded white hands, so that they were able merely to play. In the experimental condition they were represented either by a casually dressed dark-skinned virtual body (Casual Dark-Skinned - {CD}) or by a formal suited light-skinned body (Formal Light-Skinned - {FL}). Although participants of both groups experienced a strong body ownership illusion towards the virtual body, only those with the {CD} representation showed significant increases in their movement patterns for drumming compared to the baseline condition and compared with those embodied in the {FL} body. Moreover, the stronger the illusion of body ownership in the {CD} condition, the greater this behavioral change. A path analysis showed that the observed behavioral changes were a function of the strength of the illusion of body ownership towards the virtual body and its perceived appropriateness for the drumming task. These results demonstrate that full body ownership illusions can lead to substantial behavioral and possibly cognitive changes depending on the appearance of the virtual body. This could be important for many applications such as learning, education, training, psychotherapy and rehabilitation using {IVR}.},

In a study of 25 linguistically diverse teacher candidates in Canada, the respon­ dents’ native and nonnative self-ascription and self-assessed level of proﬁciency was juxtaposed with the judgment of their instructors. This process revealed that the native/nonnative dichotomy falls short in capturing the multifaceted nature of individuals’ diverse linguistic identities and tends to misrepresent them. Within the speciﬁc social context under investigation, 6 linguistic categories that better represented the true linguistic identity of participants were identiﬁed. This inquiry reconcep­ tualizes the controversial native/nonnative dichotomy by suggesting that linguistic identities should be viewed using a sociocultural lens whereby the dynamic, dialogic, multiple, and situated nature of identity is emphasized. The reconceptualization of the native/nonnative dichotomy indicates that individuals negotiate various linguistic identities in different social contexts for speciﬁc purposes.},

However, the Canadians used “repeat” more frequently than Chinese and the Chinese used “uhm” and “yeah” more than the Canadians. Participants in both groups “switched codes” when making backchannel responses, providing support for communication accommodation theory. 3) A significant negative correlation was found between the frequency of backchannel responses and participants' self-reported level of enjoyment of the conversation, raising the critical issue of how to balance the appropriate amount of backchannel response in intercultural communication.},

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 114 adult patients voluntarily participated in the study which was carried out at a clinic in Canada. Half of the participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group and half to the control group. Males and females were evenly distributed in both experimental and control groups. Prior to their medical visits, participants in the experimental group received 10-15-minute face-to-face training, whereas the control group did not receive any training. The purpose of the training was to facilitate information transmission, with the intention to increase communication effectiveness and patient satisfaction. Immediately after their medical visits, all participants filled out a patient satisfaction questionnaire. Findings - On all four dimensions of patient satisfaction (i.e. overall satisfaction, relationship satisfaction, communication satisfaction and expertise satisfaction), patients who received training scored significantly higher (were more satisfied) than patients who received no training. No consistent gender differences were found in patient satisfaction in both experimental and control groups. Research limitations/implications - This study applied a psycholinguistics theory, conversational grounding, to the field of patient education and achieved positive results. Practical implications - The success of the short training session provides health practitioners with a new method to help patients communicate more effectively, thus increasing satisfaction in medical interviews.

These difficulties in grounding can be challenging for native speakers to detect. In this paper, we examine the value of signaling potential grounding problems to native speakers ({NS}) by displaying how non-native speakers ({NNS}) use automated transcripts and bilingual dictionaries. We conducted a laboratory experiment in which {NS} and {NNS} of English collaborated via audio conferencing on a map navigation task. Triads of one {NS} guider, one {NS} follower, and one {NNS} follower performed the task using one of three awareness displays: (a) a no awareness display that showed only the automated transcripts, (b) a general awareness display that showed whether each follower was reading the automated transcripts and/or translating a word; or (c) a detailed awareness display that showed which line of the transcripts a follower was reading and/or which words he/she was translating. {NS} guiders and {NNS} followers collaborated most successfully with the detailed awareness display, while {NS} guiders and {NS} followers performed equally across conditions. Our findings suggest several ways to improve systems to support multilingual collaboration.},

The number of back channel responses and task-related utterances produced by the partners were correlated with the participants' subsequent self-reported level of understanding, involvement, and negative emotions during their conversations.

In doing so they try to minimize their joint effort. The preferred procedure is for the speaker to present a simple noun phrase and for the addressee to accept it by allowing the next contribution to begin. We describe a communication task in which pairs of people conversed about arranging complex figures and show how the proposed model accounts for many features of the references they produced.

Quantitative analyses were made to compare the communicative activities caused by the differences in conversational languages, the conversation types, and the levels of language expertise in L2. The results reveal different utterance characteristics and gaze patterns that reflect the differences in difficulty felt by the participants in each conversational condition. Both total and average durations of utterances were shorter in their L2 than in their L1 conversations. Differences in eye gazes were mainly found in those toward the information senders: Speakers were gazed at more in their second-language than in their native-language conversations.

Speech recognition errors are ubiquitous and impossible to detect reliably, so the state of the conversation can never be known with certainty. Despite this, the system must choose actions to make progress to a long term goal. As such, decision theory, and in particular partially-observable Markov decision processes ({POMDPs}), present an attractive approach to building spoken dialog systems. Initial work on "toy" dialog systems validated the benefits of the {POMDP} approach; however, it also found that straightforward application of {POMDPs} could not scale to real-world problems. Subsequent work by a number of research teams has scaled up planning and belief monitoring, incorporated high-fidelity user simulations, and married commercial development practices with automatic optimization. Today, statistical dialog systems are being fielded by research labs for public use.

There is relatively little known about how forms of emotional feedback play a role in building rapport between agents and humans. This paper describes a study in which people told stories to an agent that provided emotional feedback in the form of facial expressions. Rapport was measured through the length of the stories, the fluency of their speech, and the user's own subjective experience. Surprisingly, results indicated that inappropriate emotional feedback increased story length, which was the opposite of previous studies on envelope feedback that had shorter stories in unresponsive conditions. This paper explains the factors particular to emotional feedback that could cause this difference. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

	abstract = {More and more organizations are forming teams that are not co-located. These teams communicate via email, fax, telephone and audio conferences, and sometimes video. The question often arises whether the cost of video is worth it. Previous research has shown that video makes people more satisfied with the work, but it doesn't help the quality of the work itself. There is one exception; negotiation tasks are measurably better with video. In this study, we show that the same effect holds for a more subtle form of negotiation, when people have to negotiate meaning in a conversation. We compared the performance and communication of people explaining a map route to each other. Half the pairs have video and audio connections, half only audio. Half of the pairs were native speakers of English; the other half were non-native speakers, those presumably who have to negotiate meaning more. The results showed that non-native speaker pairs did benefit from the video; native speakers did not. Detailed analysis of the conversational strategies showed that with video, the non-native speaker pairs spent proportionately more effort negotiating common ground. Copyright © 2012 {ACM}, Inc.},

Although theoretical cultural work and some prior research suggest that high-context Chinese dyads can benefit from the visual cues available in video-enabled systems, we found little support for this hypothesis. There were no effects of culture or medium on conversational efficiency. We did find differences in word usage and quality of interaction between the groups, suggesting potential impact on long term collaborations.

	abstract = {Head pose and gesture offer several conversational grounding cues and are used extensively in face-to-face interaction among people. To accurately recognize visual feedback, humans often use contextual knowledge from previous and current events to anticipate when feedback is most likely to occur. In this paper we describe how contextual information from other participants can be used to predict visual feedback and improve recognition of head gestures in multiparty interactions (e.g., meetings). An important contribution of this paper is our data-driven representation, called co-occurrence graphs, which models co-occurrence between contextual cues such as spoken words and pauses, and visual head gestures. By analyzing these co-occurrence patterns we can automatically select relevant contextual features and predict when visual gestures are more likely. Using a discriminative approach to multi-modal integration, our contextual representation using co-occurrence graph improves head gesture recognition performance on a publicly available dataset of multi-party interactions.Copyright 2009 {ACM}.},

That ordinarily gives addressees an advantage over overhearers in understanding. Addressees have an additional advantage, we propose, because they can actively collaborate with speakers in reaching the mutual belief that they have understood what was said, whereas overhearers cannot. As evidence for the proposal, we looked at triples of people in which one person told another person in conversation how to arrange 12 complex figures while an overhearer tried to arrange them too. All three began as strangers with the same background information. As predicted, addressees were more accurate at arranging the figures than overhearers even when the overhearers heard every word. Other evidence suggests that the very process of understanding is different for addressees and overhearers. © 1989.},

We describe here the basic features of this theory and attempt to apply it in analyzing a fragment of enacted interaction. The interaction was recorded during an abdominal surgery performed with the aid of an endoscopic camera. We encountered difficulties, however, in applying contribution theory as an analytic framework within this concrete setting. We found further that the notion of common ground represents a confusing metaphor rather than a useful explanatory mechanism.

We present a model which makes this possible for robots with limited communication channels beyond the execution of task actions themselves. We implement our model in a pick-and-place robot, and experiment with two strategies for grounding uncertainty. In an observer study, we show that participants observing interactions with the robot run by the two different strategies were able to infer the degree of understanding the robot had internally, and in the more uncertainty-expressive system, were also able to perceive the degree of internal uncertainty the robot had reliably.},

	abstract = {Speakers tend to attenuate information that is predictable or repeated. To what extent is this done automatically and egocentrically, because it is easiest for speakers themselves, and to what extent is it driven by the informational needs of addressees? In 20 triads of naive subjects, speakers told the same Road Runner cartoon story twice to one addressee and once to another addressee, counterbalanced for order (Addressee1/Addressee1/Addressee2 or Addressee1/Addressee2/Addressee1). Stories retold to the same (old) addressees were attenuated compared to those retold to new addressees; this was true for events mentioned, number of words, and amount of detail. Moreover, lexically identical expressions by the same speaker were more intelligible to another group of listeners when the expressions had been addressed to new addressees than when they had been addressed to old addressees. We conclude that speakers' attenuating of information in spontaneous discourse is driven at least in part by addressees. Such audience design is computationally feasible when it can be guided by a "one-bit" model (my audience has heard this before, or not). © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The amount of information in a referring expression varied inversely with the perceived likelihood that addressees could identify the target stimulus.

They cannot even begin to coordinate on content without assuming a vast amount of shared information or common ground—that is, mutual knowledge, mutual beliefs, and mutual assumptions (Clark \& Carlson, 1982; Clark \& Marshall, 1981; Lewis, 1969; Schelling, 1960).

This study extends previous research by examining whether grounding functions in the same way in both intracultural and intercultural conditions. Participants were 40 Canadians and 40 Chinese who formed 40 dyads in 4 experimental conditions: Canadian/Canadian, Chinese/Chinese, Chinese speaker/Canadian listener, and Canadian speaker/Chinese listener. All conversations were videotaped and microanalyzed. It was found that the more dyads engaged in grounding activities, the better they communicated the information from the speaker to the listener in all experimental conditions combined. It was also found that grounding and listener recall scores were highly correlated when the Canadians served as listeners, but not when the Chinese served as listeners. This finding seems to indicate a cultural difference between Chinese and Canadians regarding the meaning of their grounding activities. Chinese listeners interact for the sake of interacting (e.g., building rapport), whereas Canadian listeners interact for the sake of transmitting content.

The contributors to this volume hope to demonstrate that attention to both cognitive and social approaches is important for understanding how language is processed in natural settings. The book opens with four review/position papers; these are followed by shorter reports of experimental findings—"a snapshot of current work that begins to bridge the product and action traditions." These treat linguistic processing issues in conversational settings, the interactions of language and nonlinguistic information from visual scenes, product approaches to issues traditionally discussed in the action tradition, and Gricean phenomena.},

We also examine power dynamics across locations by team and show that having more balanced power was typically associated with more power struggles rather than fewer. Four of the 9 teams had ongoing power contests. Each of these teams had some sources of power at one location and other sources of power at the other location. Both sites worried about losing power, felt they should have more, and struggled against losing ground. We conclude with a discussion of the need for {CSCW} to expand beyond collaboration to address issues of power. We propose ideas for systems to support globally distributed teams in creating more equal access to more sources of power and alleviating unhealthy power dynamics.},

This paper reports the findings of interviews with 14 users of {CAs} in an effort to understand the current interactional factors affecting everyday use. We find user expectations dramatically out of step with the operation of the systems, particularly in terms of known machine intelligence, system capability and goals.

Subjective reports were measured to a series of pictures that varied in both affective valence and intensity. Correlations across the two rating methods were high both for reports of experienced pleasure and felt arousal. Differences obtained in the dominance dimension of the two instruments suggest that {SAM} may better track the personal response to an affective stimulus. {SAM} is an inexpensive, easy method for quickly assessing reports of affective response in many contexts.},

In Study 1, simply changing the objects in a computer science classroom from those considered stereotypical of computer science (e.g., Star Trek poster, video games) to objects not considered stereotypical of computer science (e.g., nature poster, phone books) was sufficient to boost female undergraduates’ interest in computer science to the level of their male peers. Further investigation revealed that the stereotypical broadcast a masculine stereotype that discouraged women’s sense of ambient belonging and subsequent interest in the environment (Studies 2, 3, and 4) but had no similar effect on men (Studies 3, 4). This masculine stereotype prevented women’s interest from developing even in environments entirely populated by other women (Study 2). Objects can thus come to broadcast stereotypes of a group, which in turn can deter people who do not identify with these stereotypes from joining that group.},

The process of producing and interpreting speech is described through a message transfer circle. The model also includes the mental worlds of the speaker and the recipient, which substantially influence interaction. In addition, special attention is paid to recipient design, which plays a crucial role in interaction. One may even argue that such frequently mentioned factors as misreference or ambiguity are not causes of miscommunication but only risks for it; the real cause of miscommunication is incomplete recipient design. The common denominator is the egocentrism of the speaker: avoidance of cognitive effort, common ground fallacy, emotional overdrive, obstacles caused by physiological state or physical defects, and attaching greater importance to other things at the expense of recipient design.},

This paper explores how interaction designers used techniques from theatrical improvisation, or improv, to adhere to the rules of brainstorming thereby enhancing group interactions while collaborating. The usefulness of improvisation for brainstorming stems from the similarity of the goals of improvisation and brainstorming, the similarity of the recurrent problems that actors and designers encounter when collaborating, and the distinctness of the ways each have devised to resolve the problems that block the group’s performance. This paper reflects on the individual- and group-level outcomes for design students and practitioners while brainstorming.},

The pictures generally enhanced performance as measured by both originality and diversity of ideas. The pictures also helped to convert cultural diversity into a creative outcome, the diversity of ideas generated. We argue that with appropriate technology mediation, cultural diversity may be used strategically to enhance task outcomes.},

	abstract = {Diversity among members of international teams can be a valuable source of novel ideas. However, to reap these benefits, groups need to overcome communication barriers that stem from differences in members’ native languages. We compare two strategies for overcoming these barriers: the use of English as a common language, and the use of machine translation ({MT}) tools that allow each person to communicate in his or her own native language. Dyads consisting of one English-speaking American and one native Mandarin-speaking Chinese participant exchanged ideas to perform brainstorming tasks, either through English or using {MT}. We found that {MT} helped the non-native English speakers produce ideas but that both native and non-native English speakers viewed {MT}-mediated messages as less comprehensible than English messages. The findings suggest it can be effective to support crosslingual communication with asymmetric design, using {MT} technology to help people produce messages in their native languages, while leaving incoming messages untranslated and leveraging people’s second language proficiency for comprehension.},

Data were collectedfrom subjects having a dyadic conversation in a lab, in two contrasting settings (intercultural and intracultural). The analyses indicate that interaction involvement indeed influences message production at the subtle level of topic selection, such that {LIIs} and {HIIs} adapt in different ways to the situational difserence (talking to strangers in intracultural vs. intercultural setting).},

A consequence of this growth is that the state of social {VR} application design has become increasingly obfuscated, which complicates identification of design trends, best practices, and uncommon features that are perhaps worthy of wider adoption. To help address this problem, this paper presents a taxonomy of social {VR} application design choices as informed by 29 commercial and prototypical applications in the literature. Discussion of the taxonomy highlights novel features of research prototypes that could potentially enrich the social experience in commercially available applications.

We found that {NNS} often shifted between English and their native language. The way language shift happened differed for formal meetings, informal conversations, and instant messaging. Language variation was often associated with shifts in content, participants, and communication medium. Further analysis indicated that language shift had both benefits and costs for team communication, depending on the context in which it happened.

The design review is an important part of the design process of a new product, because its objective is to ensure the quality of the final product. During a design review several experts discuss the current state of the work, trying to locate errors in the design, develop improvements or find solutions for unsolved problems. It is evident that the quality of the achieved results of such a review is directly linked to the quality of the collaboration between the involved experts. Apart from social issues, efficient collaboration is heavily influenced by technical aspects, e.g. which kind of media is used. Since pure digital data representations of the design is commonplace today, new metaphors have to be developed which allow a group of people to work together simultaneously and intuitively on the same data model.},

Current industry approaches to avatars in social {VR} applications vary widely, and the (sometimes tacit) design knowledge acquired by those who created these platforms has much to offer research in {HCI}. In this paper, we describe current design practices, and reflect on the design approaches that characterize avatars and avatar systems in this emerging commercial sector. To investigate design approaches to avatar systems and their impact on communication and interaction with people within this medium, we interviewed industry experts associated with a range of platforms including Rec Room, {AltspaceVR}, High Fidelity, {VRChat}, Anyland, and Mozilla Hubs. In analyzing the ways that design choices shape embodied experience, we map design approaches to avatar systems in this evolving landscape and make preliminary claims about the impact of these varying design approaches.},

We review the literature on task and integrate this literature in the context of experimental collaborative group work. l?u bulk of the task literature suggests that a workable and valid clasn3cation system must be built both on characteristicsthat are innate to a task and on characteristics of the task performer. Based on this framework, plus work done by Hackman (I\%9), a model of group task processing is proposed. As part of this model, a relatively unused type of task called a hidden profile task is documented and contrasted with other tasks which have been used in computer supported group research. Hidden projile tasks have much to offer group laboratory research. These tasks distributetask relevant information among group members to induce heterogeneity within the group. We argue that the use of hidden profile tasks in laboratory research will help to "close the gap" between field and laboratory research since groups in field settings generally come together with heterogeneous information and perspectives.},

To examine this model, dyads communicating through face-to-face, videophone, telephone (i.e., audio-only communication), or synchronous computer-mediated communication worked in a laboratory experiment to address an intellective or negotiation task. The intellective task required that each dyad member effectively share factual information that each individual independently held. The negotiation task required that each dyad member effectively share preferences based on personal values and reach an agreement. The results of the study provide mixed support for the taskmedia fit hypothesis. In general, the results for the negotiation task largely supported the theory while the results for the intellective task did not support the theory. These results help to clarify limitations and provide extensions to the theory by demonstrating how variations in task processes and communication media act to mediate task performance. The implications of these results for future research and practice are discussed.},

Departing from existing work on inclusion and complementing this with theoretical insights from optimal distinctiveness theory and self-determination theory, we proposed that inclusion is a hierarchical two-dimensional concept consisting of perceptions of belonging and authenticity. In addition, we posed that in the process of inclusion, it is the group rather than the individual that has primary agency. From this conceptualization, we developed and validated the 16-item perceived group inclusion scale ({PGIS}). Data from two samples supported our proposed conﬁguration of inclusion. In addition, the {PGIS} appeared to be a reliable measure of inclusion and was demonstrated to possess both nomological and predictive validity. Taken together, this research contributes to the conceptual reﬁnement of the inclusion construct and offers researchers a reliable and valid tool to conduct future inclusion research.

In Study 1 we focused on prospective employees. We found that an all-inclusive diversity approach, compared with the “standard” multicultural approach in which the majority group is not explicitly made part of organizational diversity, led to higher levels of anticipated inclusion for those with a high need to belong. In Study 2 we turned to sitting organizational members. Here, we again found that an all-inclusive multicultural approach increased perceptions of inclusion, but now the effect was present regardless of individual levels of need to belong. Perceived inclusion, in turn, was positively related to majority members’ support for organizational diversity efforts. Together, these findings underline the effectiveness of an all-inclusive multicultural approach towards diversity.},

Data from a national survey of public agencies conducted in Florida and Texas show that gender dissimilarity is negatively associated with perceptions of inclusion and the negative relationship is more acute for men than for women. In contrast, tenure dissimilarity is positively related to perceptions of inclusion and this positive association is more acute for those with longer tenure than for those with shorter tenure. These results suggest that the effect of dissimilarity on the perception of inclusion depends on both the observability of individual-level characteristics and the status of the demographic group. In particular, dissimilarity along characteristics that are easily observable (such as gender) is more likely to influence perceptions of inclusion and dissimilarity is more influential for higher status groups (such as men or long-tenured employees).},

	abstract = {In the present research, we introduced a conceptual framework of inclusion and subsequently used this as a starting point to develop and validate a scale to measure perceptions of inclusion. Departing from existing work on inclusion and complementing this with theoretical insights from optimal distinctiveness theory and self-determination theory, we proposed that inclusion is a hierarchical two-dimensional concept consisting of perceptions of belonging and authenticity. In addition, we posed that in the process of inclusion, it is the group rather than the individual that has primary agency. From this conceptualization, we developed and validated the 16-item perceived group inclusion scale ({PGIS}). Data from two samples supported our proposed conﬁguration of inclusion. In addition, the {PGIS} appeared to be a reliable measure of inclusion and was demonstrated to possess both nomological and predictive validity. Taken together, this research contributes to the conceptual reﬁnement of the inclusion construct and offers researchers a reliable and valid tool to conduct future inclusion research.

In Study 1 we focused on prospective employees. We found that an all-inclusive diversity approach, compared with the “standard” multicultural approach in which the majority group is not explicitly made part of organizational diversity, led to higher levels of anticipated inclusion for those with a high need to belong. In Study 2 we turned to sitting organizational members. Here, we again found that an all-inclusive multicultural approach increased perceptions of inclusion, but now the effect was present regardless of individual levels of need to belong. Perceived inclusion, in turn, was positively related to majority members’ support for organizational diversity efforts. Together, these findings underline the effectiveness of an all-inclusive multicultural approach towards diversity.},

Consistent with the authors’ predictions, results showed that proself groups performed worse on the convergent aspects of this task but better on the divergent aspects than prosocial groups. In Experiment 2, the authors manipulated social motive and negotiation (negotiation vs. no negotiation), and groups performed a creativity task (requiring divergent performance) or a planning task (requiring convergent performance). Proself groups showed greater dedication, functioned more effectively, and performed better than prosocial groups on the creativity task, whereas prosocial groups showed greater dedication, functioned more effectively, and performed better than proself groups on the planning task, and these effects only occurred when the task was preceded by group negotiation.},

Consequently, this paper reports the results of two experiments investigating the influence of interruptions on individual decision making. Interruptions were found to improve decision-making performance on simple tasks and to lower performance on complex tasks. For complex tasks, the frequency of intemptions and the dissimilarity of content between the primary and interruption tasks was found to exacerbate this effect. The implications of these results for future research and practice are discussed.},

We use converging measures to document the development of common ground in the teams and present an in-depth analysis of the characteristics of the common ground development process. Our findings indicate that in complex collaborative work, process common ground increases, thus diminishing the need for acts like information querying or strategy discussions about how to organize the collaborative activities. However, content common ground is created and tested throughout the three runs; in fact dialogue acts used to clarify this content increase over time. Discussion of the implications of these findings for the theory of common ground and the design of collaborative systems follows.},

The ﬁrst portion of this article provides a thorough yet non-technical description of the sphericity assumption and explains why violations of sphericity lead to an inﬂated Type I error rate. The second portion describes univariate and multivariate approaches for addressing the problem of an inﬂated Type I error rate. The univariate approach involves estimating the parameter ε that reﬂects the degree to which sphericity is violated and then reducimg the degrees of freedom by multiplying them by the estimate of ε. Two estimates of ε, εˆ and ε˜, have been recommended. The former has lower power than the latter whereas the latter fails to fully control the Type I error rate under some circumstances. The multivariate approach does not assume sphericity and therefore does not have an inﬂated Type I error rate. A decision tree for deciding among εˆ, ε˜, and the multivariate approach based on a review of previously published simulations is presented along with a {JavaScript} program to automate the navigation of the decision tree.},

We discuss an interface agent prototype that is designed to support human-human communication in virtual environments. The prototype interacts with users strategically during conversation, spending most of its time listening. The prototype mimics a party host, trying to find a safe common topic for guests whose conversation has lagged. We performed an experimental evaluation of the prototype's ability to assist in cross-cultural conversations. We designed the prototype to introduce safe or unsafe topics to conversation pairs, through a series of questions and suggestions. The agent made positive contributions to participants' experience of the conversation, influenced their perception of each other and of each others' national group, and even seemed to effect their style of behavior. We discuss the implications of our research for the design of social agents to support human-human interaction.},

A novel modeling approach was designed for the analysis of archived threaded discussions to facilitate answer extraction. We compare a self-out and an all-in evaluation of the mined answers. The results show that the discussion-bot can begin to meet students’ learning requests.

Additionally, we highlight a number of nuanced practicalities of their use in multi-party settings. By providing a depiction of the nature and methodical practice of their use, we are able to contribute our findings to the design of {IPAs}.},

This implies a level of conversational organization in which groups of individuals form a coherent unit. This paper investigates the implications of this phenomenon for psycholinguistic and semantic models of shared context in dialog. We present a corpus study of multiparty dialog which shows that, in certain circumstances, people with different levels of overt involvement in a conversation, that is, one responding and one not, can nonetheless access the same shared context. We argue that contemporary models of shared context need to be adapted to capture this situation. To address this, we propose “grounding by proxy,” in which one person can respond on behalf of another, as a simple mechanism by which shared context can accumulate for a coalition as a whole. We explore this hypothesis experimentally by investigating how people in a task-oriented coalition respond when their shared context appears to be weakened. The results provide evidence that, by default, coalition members act on each other’s behalf, and when this fails they work to compensate. We conclude that this points to the need for a new concept of collective grounding acts and a corresponding concept of collective contexts in psycholinguistic and semantic models of dialog.},

Hence, we aimed to explore the feasibility of a facilitator chatbot agent to improve group chat discussions. We conducted a needﬁnding survey to identify key features for a facilitator chatbot. We then implemented {GroupfeedBot}, a chatbot agent that could facilitate group discussions by managing the discussion time, encouraging members to participate evenly, and organizing members’ opinions. To evaluate {GroupfeedBot}, we performed preliminary user studies that varied for diverse tasks and different group sizes. We found that the group with {GroupfeedBot} appeared to exhibit more diversity in opinions even though there were no differences in output quality and message quantity. On the other hand, {GroupfeedBot} promoted members’ even participation and effective communication for the medium-sized group.},

This discourse analytic stage of research builds on an initial survey which explored the use of English for International Business ({EIB}) in a particular European organisation. The survey uncovered a range of communication issues and frustrations raised by meeting participants as well as an awareness of some of the strategies that could be used to overcome them (Rogerson-Revell, 2007). This analysis of the meeting discourse attempts to relate these perceptions to the actual interactive characteristics of the meetings themselves. Initial ﬁndings suggest that there is some support for the issues raised in the survey, particularly with regard to levels of participation, for, although Native English Speakers ({NSE}) do not dominate talk in terms of talk time, there is a much higher proportion of inactive {NonNative} English Speakers ({NNSE}) in the meetings. However, despite concerns from some participants that communication in English can be problematic, the analysis illustrates the overall positive linguistic performance of speakers in the meetings themselves. It also reveals some of the ways active participants employ a variety of interactive resources and strategies to achieve substantive goals and to establish a sense of normality in situ despite generic and linguistic constraints. The study also suggests that the apparent paradox between the negative perceptions of some participants and the overall positive performance of speakers in the meetings themselves needs further investigation.},

The two phases together constitute a unit of conversation we call a contribution. The two phases may each have contributions embedded within them, so conversations consist of both sequential and hierarchical arrangements of contributions. As evidence for these proposals, we examine four types of contributions that occurred in directory enquiries of the telephone company. From this and other evidence, we argue that contributions appear to be a general feature of conversations.},

By systematically varying the levels of theoretically important vignette characteristics a large population of different vignettes is typically available – too large to be presented to each respondent. Therefore, each respondent gets only a subset of vignettes. These subsets may either be randomly selected in following the tradition of the factorial survey or systematically selected according to an experimental design. We show that these strategies in selecting vignette sets have strong implications for the analysis and interpretation of vignette data. Random selection strategies result in a random confounding of effects and heavily rely on the assumption of no interaction effects. In contrast, experimental strategies systematically confound interaction effects with main or set effects, thereby preserving a meaningful interpretation of main and important interaction effects. Using a pilot study on attitudes toward immigrants we demonstrate the implementation and analysis of a confounded factorial design.},

Beyond these virtual agents’ professional expertise, they must have a social dimension to build long-term relationships with users. Interpersonal intimacy is at the core of the most gratifying social exchanges, and we claim that it could constitute a remarkable means to reinforce the social dimension of {ECAs}. This paper presents an experimental study that compares the perception of intimacy in human and human-agent interactions. Are nature and social expressiveness critical factors for the perception of intimacy? To answer this question, we created two corpora of videos showing a human or a virtual tourism information ({TI}) counselor using or not using intimate behaviors in the course of an interaction with a human tourist. Using the Virtual Intimacy Scale ({VIS}) designed in previous work, we asked observers to judge the intimacy level of the {TI} counselor during the interaction. We demonstrate that intimate behaviors expressed by the virtual counselor and the human counselor are equally perceived by participants, which supposes a common model of intimacy for human and human-agent dyads. Participants perceive the human counselor less intimate than the virtual counselor when having non intimate behaviors. We posit that humans and agents elicit diﬀerent expectations regarding social abilities, which directly aﬀect their perceived level of intimacy. Our work raises questions regarding the expression of social behaviors and questions social representations.},

The study is based on 14 months of field work and 51 interviews and observations at two Israeli geriatric wards with highly diverse staff. I show that actors negotiate their care worker identity by the opposite strategies of making and unmaking ethno-national boundaries. The first strategy denies and erases ethno-national boundaries by stressing universal professional values and individual virtues; the second one demarcates boundaries between ethnonational groups, using perceived cultural differences.

We created a fictitious Facebook page of a female Chinese international student and experimentally manipulated her Facebook posts to represent low or high English proficiency. American students (N = 126) in the high proficiency condition reported more identification with the international student, which subsequently led to more desire for future interaction with the student both online and in person. These effects generalized to a desire for interaction with other Chinese students (again, both online and in person). The findings of the study have theoretical and practical implications for online intergroup communication.},

However, when other-generated and self-generated wall posts were consistent, other-generated posts produced an averaging eﬀect.

Existing theories regarding effects of communication on trust problems stress the influence of information about behaviour of potential partners. Effects of imitation are less extensively elaborated in the literature. In this article, the authors develop a theory about imitation in combination with other network effects on trust. They propose a distinction between imitation and other types of learning, contrasting trustors who only know that other trustors have been trustful in transactions with a trustee with trustors who also know that this trustee was in fact trustworthy. The theory predicts that both imitation and learning have an effect in trust situations and that these effects depend on uncertainties for the trustor. The authors designed a vignette experiment that enables the distinction between imitation and learning for different levels of uncertainty. The experiment provides strong support for learning effects on trust and some support for imitation effects. There is only limited evidence that the imitation effects depend on uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Background Epidemiologic studies have reported differences in the use of cardiovascular procedures according to the race and sex of the patient. Whether the differences stem from differences in the recommendations of physicians remains uncertain.
Methods We developed a computerized survey instrument to assess physicians’ recommendations for managing chest pain. Actors portrayed patients with particular characteristics in scripted interviews about their symptoms. A total of 720 physicians at two national meetings of organizations of primary care physicians participated in the survey. Each physician viewed a recorded interview and was given other data about a hypothetical patient. He or she then made recommendations about that patient’s care. We used multivariate logistic-regression analysis to assess the effects of the race and sex of the patients on treatment recommendations, while controlling for the physicians’ assessment of the probability of coronary artery disease as well as for the age of the patient, the level of coronary risk, the type of chest pain, and the results of an exercise stress test.
Results The physicians’ mean (±{SD}) estimates of the probability of coronary artery disease were lower for women (probability, 64.1±19.3 percent, vs. 69.2±18.2 percent for men; P{\textless}0.001), younger patients (63.8±19.5 percent for patients who were 55 years old, vs. 69.5±17.9 percent for patients who were 70 years old; P{\textless}0.001), and patients with nonanginal pain (58.3±19.0 percent, vs. 64.4±18.3 percent for patients with possible angina and 77.1±14.0 percent for those with definite angina; P{\textless}0.001). Logistic-regression analysis indicated that women (odds ratio, 0.60; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.4 to 0.9; P=0.02) and blacks (odds ratio, 0.60; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.4 to 0.9; P=0.02) were less likely to be referred for cardiac catheterization than men and whites, respectively. Analysis of race–sex interactions showed that black women were significantly less likely to be referred for catheterization than white men (odds ratio, 0.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.7; P=0.004).
Conclusions Our findings suggest that the race and sex of a patient independently influence how physicians manage chest pain. (N Engl J Med 1999; 340:618-26.)},

We present {SenseTrans}, a tool that provides emotional and contextual annotations generated by natural language analysis in addition to machine translation. We evaluated {SenseTrans} in a laboratory experiment in which native English speakers browsed five Facebook profiles in foreign languages. One group used the {SenseTrans} interface while the other group used {MT} alone. Participants using {SenseTrans} reported significantly greater understanding of the posts, and greater willingness to engage with the posts. However, no additional cognitive load was associated with using an interface that provided more information. These results provide promising support for the idea of using computational tools to annotate communication to support multilingual sense making and interaction on social media.},

	abstract = {It is well established in studies of two-party conversation that conversational partners jointly establish brief labels for repeatedly mentioned entities. When speaking to a new partner who is unfamiliar with the labels, speakers use longer expressions to facilitate understanding. How this process of audience design scales up to multiparty conversation, where individuals differ in mutual knowledge, is unknown. Here we propose, and test, three potential hypotheses regarding how speakers design referring expressions in threeparty conversation. Participants completed a referential communication task in groups of three in which one participant, the Director, gave instructions to two Matchers who differed in their knowledge of referential labels. Directors flexibly alternated between partner-specific representations of common ground ({CG}), producing longer descriptions for low-{CG} than for high-{CG} partners. When addressing multiple parties at once, speakers tailored descriptions for the least knowledgeable person. These findings shed light on the mechanisms that support audience design in multiparty conversation: Audience design begins with access to distinct representations of common ground held with the intended addressee or addressees. These distinct representations support an audience design process in which utterances are tailored to accommodate the least knowledgeable addressee in a group.},

In this paper, we discuss possible mechanisms that might lead to linguistic alignment, contrasting mechanisms that are encapsulated within the language processing system, and so unmediated by beliefs about the interlocutor, with mechanisms that are mediated by beliefs about the interlocutor and that are concerned with considerations of either communicative success or social affect. We consider how these mechanisms might be implicated in human–computer interaction ({HCI}), and then review recent empirical studies that investigated linguistic alignment in {HCI}. We argue that there is strong evidence that alignment occurs in {HCI}, but that it differs in important ways from that found in interactions between humans: It is generally stronger and has a larger mediated component that is concerned with enhancing communicative success.},

It is argued that narratives containing “false facts” can effectively portray a speaker’s theory of another individual’s character. Thus, such narratives are useful for gathering information about leaders and other important individuals who are evaluated in the community. After deriving the theory, {TIF} is used to derive propositions predicting the empirical conditions under which misinformation will be accepted, tolerated or promoted.

	abstract = {Fueled by the pervasion of tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams, the usage of text-based communication in distributed teams has grown massively in organizations. This brings distributed teams many advantages, however, a critical shortcoming in these setups is the decreased ability of perceiving, understanding and regulating emotions. This is problematic because better team members’ abilities of emotion management positively impact team-level outcomes like team cohesion and team performance, while poor abilities diminish communication flow and well-being. Leveraging chatbot technology in distributed teams has been recognized as a promising approach to reintroduce and improve upon these abilities. In this article we present three chatbot designs for emotion management for distributed teams. In order to develop these designs, we conducted three participatory design workshops which resulted in 153 sketches. Subsequently, we evaluated the designs following an exploratory evaluation with 27 participants. Results show general stimulating effects on emotion awareness and communication efficiency. Further, they report emotion regulation and increased compromise facilitation through social and interactive design features, but also perceived threats like loss of control. With some design features adversely impacting emotion management, we highlight design implications and discuss chatbot design recommendations for enhancing emotion management in teams. {CCS} Concepts: • Human-centered computing → Computer supported cooperative work; Natural language interfaces; Participatory design.},

We study the linguistic features associated with politeness across American English and Mandarin Chinese. First, we annotate 5,300 Twitter posts from the United States ({US}) and 5,300 Sina Weibo posts from China for politeness scores. Next, we develop an English and Chinese politeness feature set, ‘{PoliteLex}’. Combining it with validated psycholinguistic dictionaries, we study the correlations between linguistic features and perceived politeness across cultures. We find that on Mandarin Weibo, future-focusing conversations, identifying with a group affiliation, and gratitude are considered more polite compared to English Twitter. Death-related taboo topics, use of pronouns (with the exception of honorifics), and informal language are associated with higher impoliteness on Mandarin Weibo than on English Twitter. Finally, we build language-based machine learning models to predict politeness with an F1 score of 0.886 on Mandarin Weibo and 0.774 on English Twitter. {CCS} Concepts: • Social and professional topics → Cultural characteristics; • Information systems → Data mining; • Applied computing → Psychology; Sociology.},

Further, feedback affects language use. This suggests that a system could use linguistic analysis to automatically provide and visualize feedback to teach teamwork.

Motivating people to contribute is a key problem because the quantity and quality of contributions ultimately determine a {CALV}’s value. We pose two related research questions: 1) How does intelligent task routing—matching people with work—affect the quantity of contributions? 2) How does reviewing contributions before accepting them affect the quality of contributions? A ﬁeld experiment with 197 contributors shows that simple, intelligent task routing algorithms have large effects. We also model the effect of reviewing contributions on the value of {CALVs}. The model predicts, and experimental data shows, that value grows more slowly with review before acceptance. It also predicts, surprisingly, that a {CALV} will reach the same ﬁnal value whether contributions are reviewed before or after they are made available to the community.},

We use Karau and Williams’ collective effort model to predict how peer and expert editorial oversight affect members’ contributions to a movie recommendation website and test these predictions in a ﬁeld experiment with 87 contributors. Oversight increased both the quantity and quality of contributions while reducing antisocial behavior, and peers were as effective at oversight as experts.

We conducted a scenario-based study of 459 respondents in a global high-tech company. Our data indicate cultural differences in how social network information was valued when choosing a collaborator. The Chinese, consistent with the cultural value of Guanxi, more closely followed a closure model, whereas Americans favored neither a closure nor a structural holes model. These results provide new insights into how needs for social network information may vary between cultures and how social networking sites might support workers in choosing collaborators from within and across national cultures.},

In this study, we discuss how older adults who are aging in place actively promote their well-being through the lens of interacting and socializing with others. We conducted an interview study with 10 participants to understand how they develop and maintain interpersonal relationships with others. We found that older adults took charge in creating, building, developing, and maintaining a safety net, which is reflected in the following four representations: pre-determined network, chosen network, interest-based network, and shared-identity network. We also identified three important characteristics of the safety net: coproducing, reciprocating, and strengthening identity, which influence older adults’ personal and social experiences.},

To delve into this complex and multifaceted space, we welcome workshop submissions that 1) engage broadly with the role of culture within technology design and usage for, with and by communities, as well as 2) proposals for approaches, tools, conceptual and methodological frameworks, case studies and best practices in community-based design that exploit cultural diversity as an asset and seek to encourage intercultural interactions. Our goal is to bring together academics and practitioners from different domains such as computer science, urban design, interactive art, anthropology and social sciences who share a common interest in exploring the design space of {ICTs}, culture and communities.},

Through 24 in-depth qualitative interviews, this empirical, exploratory study examines the nuances of com- munication practices with animated {GIFs} to better understand why and how {GIFs} can send unintentional messages. We find participants leverage contexts like source material and interpersonal relationship to find the perfect {GIFs} for different communication scenarios, while these contexts are also the primary reason for miscommunication and some technical usability issues in {GIFs}. This paper concludes with a discussion of the important role that different types of context play in the use and interpretations of {GIFs}, and argues that nonverbal communication tools should account for complex contexts and common ground that communication media rely on.},

It holds the promise of providing information that is otherwise challenging to access, which sets the stage for understanding and resolving various social issues. However, difficulties in engaging participants often hinder the fulfillment of this promise. The current paper presents a qualitative study in the context of dockless bikesharing, where participatory sensing constitutes a backbone of the bike status monitoring system. We conducted in-depth interviews with 30 participants. These participants came from different emergent groups who took part in filing status reports for shared bikes. Our analysis indicated close associations among participants’ models of engagement, their perceived (dis)connections with the sensing data, and their situated interpretation of the incentives. Based on these findings, we propose ways to engage the commons in participatory sensing for dockless bikesharing and beyond.},

Focusing on Chinese students’ acculturation in the United States, this research compared these two theoretical perspectives in general, and cross-cultural adaptation theory and cultural fusion theory in particular. Through conducting in-depth interviews with 25 Chinese students studying in an American public university, this research revealed that these migrating individuals from China were still attached to their Chinese identity and embraced interaction with other Chinese people to varying degrees during their acculturation. Their acculturation experiences supported cultural fusion theory, which argues that acculturation is an additive and integrated process rather than a zero-sum closed system.},

From this perspective, surprisingly little {HCI} research can be found scrutinizing the existence, role, and potential of humor in our design practice. The gap remains also related to children and teenagers; there is a lack of studies appreciating the emergence and existence of humor in the design process without intentionally evoking it. Thus, this study examines humor as a naturally occurring phenomenon in the design process. The study was conducted in collaboration with a class of teenagers and their teachers. The study identifies various forms and functions of humor in the design process and reveals its situated, emergent nature as a resource in interaction within design. The study proposes a practical tool for designers for anticipating and potentially facilitating the emergence, forms and usages of humor as an interactional resource in design.},

We describe the experience of 6 globally-distributed work groups who used the tool over a period of 17 months. An analysis of use shows that the group functionality was used primarily for bursts of synchronous conversations and occasional asynchronous exchanges. The content was primarily focused on work tasks, and negotiating availability, with a smattering of non-work topics and humor. Nearly all groups were remarkably similar in the content of their group chat, although the research group chatted far more frequently than the others.

In this paper, we report on an interview study of 31 participants that examines how people handle online event invitations and what influences their online and offline participation. The results show that people’s event participation is shaped by their social perceptions of the event’s nature (e.g., public or private), their relationships to others (e.g., the strength of their connections to other invitees), and the medium used to communicate event information (e.g., targeted invitation via email or spam communication via Facebook event page). By exploring how people decide whether to participate online or offline, the results illuminate the sophisticated nature of the mechanisms that affect participation and have design implications that can bridge virtual and real attendance.},

We then describe an interview study in which we asked 22 participants from America, Korea, India and China about their perceptions of media and motivations for media choices in different hypothetical settings. The results suggest cultural differences in how media are perceived, specifically, that the ability for media to support social in addition to task processes is more important for participants from China, Korea and India than for participants from the U.S. We conclude with some recommendations for enhancing {CMC} theories to account for cultural differences.},

The unit, breadth and intensity of an {MNC}’s language system are designed to apply global strategies within the context of evolving environmental and organizational realities. To the extent that language design is the product of deliberate choice, we suggest that headquarters functional language is determined by the {MNC}’s international strategy, organizational structure, and transnationality, while subunit functional language is designed in accordance with organizational form, strategic role, and expatriate deployment. Aligning language systems with organizational strategy and dynamics improves {MNC} communication, coordination, and knowledge-sharing.},

To investigate the impact of biased estimations of a layperson’s knowledge on the effectiveness of experts’ explanations, we conducted a web-based dialog experiment with 45 pairs of experts and laypersons. We manipulated the experts’ mental model of the layperson by presenting them either valid information about the layperson’s knowledge or information that was biased towards overestimation or underestimation. Results showed that the experts adopted the biased estimations and adapted their explanations accordingly. Consequently, the laypersons’ learning from the experts’ explanations was impaired when the experts overestimated or underestimated the layperson’s knowledge. In addition, laypersons whose knowledge was overestimated more often generated questions that reﬂected comprehension problems. Laypersons whose knowledge was underestimated asked mainly for additional information previously not addressed in the explanations. The results suggest that underestimating a learner during the instructional dialog is as detrimental to learning as is the overestimation of a learner’s knowledge. Thus, the provision of effective explanations presupposes an accurate mental model of the learner’s knowledge prerequisites.},

	abstract = {Knowledge can be a curse: Once we have acquired a particular item of knowledge it tends to bias, or contaminate, our ability to reason about a less informed perspective (referred to as the ‘curse of knowledge’ or ‘hindsight bias’). The mechanisms underlying the curse of knowledge bias are a matter of great import and debate. We highlight two mechanisms that have been proposed to underlie this bias—inhibition and ﬂuency misattribution. Explanations that involve inhibition argue that people have difﬁculty fully inhibiting or suppressing the content of their knowledge when trying to reason about a less informed perspective. Explanations that involve ﬂuency misattribution focus on the feelings of ﬂuency with which the information comes to mind and the tendency to misattribute the subjective feelings of ﬂuency associated with familiar items to the objective ease or foreseeability of that information. Three experiments with a total of 359 undergraduate students provide the ﬁrst evidence that ﬂuency misattribution processes are sufﬁcient to induce the curse of knowledge bias. These results add to the literature on the many manifestations of the curse of knowledge bias and the many types of source misattributions, by revealing their role in people’s judgements of how common, or widespread, one’s knowledge is. The implications of these results for cognitive science and social cognition are discussed.},

However, little is known about what influences our partner models in spoken interactions with artificial partners. In our experiment we asked people to name 15 British landmarks, and estimate their identifiability to a person as well as an automated conversational agent of either British or American origin. Our results show that people’s assumptions about what an artificial partner knows are related to their estimates of what other people are likely to know but they generally estimate artificial partners to have more knowledge in the task than human partners. These findings shed light on the way in which people build partner models of artificial partners. Importantly, they suggest that people use assumptions about what other humans know as a heuristic when assessing an artificial partner’s knowledge.},

This phenomenon has important implications for how we come to believe oft-repeated information that may be misleading or unknown. Behavioral evidence indicates that fluency, the subjective ease experienced while processing information, underlies this effect. This suggests that illusory truth should be mediated by brain regions previously linked to fluency, such as the perirhinal cortex ({PRC}). To investigate this possibility, we scanned participants with {fMRI} while they rated the truth of unknown statements, half of which were presented earlier (i.e., repeated). The only brain region that showed an interaction between repetition and ratings of perceived truth was {PRC}, where activity increased with truth ratings for repeated, but not for new, statements. This finding supports the hypothesis that illusory truth is mediated by a fluency mechanism and further strengthens the link between {PRC} and fluency.},

We also found that children’s misattributions were asymmetric. They were limited to cases in which the children were more knowledgeable than the other person; misattributions did not occur when the children were more ignorant than the other person.

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose to explore the effects of fluency and perspective-taking on the perceived helpfulness of online product reviews. Past research has suggested that fluency, or ease of information processing, can be used as information when individuals are making various judgments. For example, fluency increases liking. Thus, we predict that fluency can influence perceptions of review helpfulness. Moreover, researchers have found that social distance, or the distinction between self and other, can affect judgment. Specifically, taking other-perspective can reduce feelings in response to disfluency. Therefore, we further predict that a review presented in fluent information will be perceived as more helpful than one in disfluent information when individuals consider a product for themselves, but not when they imagine that another person will purchase the product. To test the theoretical model proposed, we will present a book review in easy- and hard-to-read fonts in Study 1, and prepare another review in high- and low-contrast texts in Study 2. Participants will be instructed to take self- or otherperspective when rating review helpfulness. Our results will indicate the important roles of fluency and perspective-taking in consumer evaluation of online product reviews and provide implications for consumers and online retailers.},

In particular, we show a curse-of-knowledge bias in false-belief reasoning. That is, adults’ own knowledge of an event’s outcome can compromise their ability to reason about another person’s beliefs about that event. We also found that adults’ perception of the plausibility of an event mediates the extent of this bias.

	abstract = {By 6 years, children have a sophisticated adult-like theory of mind that enables them not only to understand the actions of social agents in terms of underlying mental states, but also to distinguish between their own mental states and those of others. Despite this, we argue that even adults do not reliably use this sophisticated ability for the very purpose for which it is designed, to interpret the actions of others. In Experiment 1, a person who played the role of “director” in a communication game instructed a participant to move certain objects around in a grid. Before receiving instructions, participants hid an object in a bag, such that they but not the director would know its identity. Occasionally, the descriptions that the director used to refer to a mutually-visible object more closely matched the identity of the object hidden in the bag. Although they clearly knew that the director did not know the identity of the hidden object, they often took it as the referent of the director’s description, sometimes even attempting to comply with the instruction by actually moving the bag itself. In Experiment 2 this occurred even when the participants believed that the director had a false belief about the identity of the hidden object, i.e. that she thought that a different object was in the bag. These results show a stark dissociation between an ability to reﬂectively distinguish one’s own beliefs from others’, and the routine deployment of this ability in interpreting the actions of others. We propose that this dissociation indicates that important elements of the adult’s theory of mind are not fully incorporated into the human comprehension system.},

            We examined the universality of the curse of knowledge (i.e., the tendency to be biased by one’s knowledge when inferring other perspectives) by investigating it in a unique cross-cultural sample; a nomadic Nilo-Saharan pastoralist society in East Africa, the Turkana. Forty Turkana children were asked eight factual questions and asked to predict how widely-known those facts were among their peers. To test the effect of their knowledge, we taught children the answers to half of the questions, while the other half were unknown. Based on findings suggesting the bias’s universality, we predicted that children would estimate that more of their peers would know the answers to the questions that were taught versus the unknown questions. We also predicted that with age children would become less biased by their knowledge. In contrast, we found that only Turkana males were biased by their knowledge when inferring their peers’ perspectives, and the bias did not change with age. We discuss the implications of these findings.},

We tested these predictions using a paradigm based on semantic integration. We coded the frequencies with which participants falsely recalled the word ‘‘thought’’ as ‘‘knew’’ (or a near synonym), yielding an implicit measure of conceptual activation. Our experiments conﬁrmed the predictions of our Bayesian account of knowledge attribution across three experiments. We found that Gettier cases due to counterfeit objects were not treated as knowledge (Experiment 1), but those due to intentionally-replaced evidence were (Experiment 2). Our ﬁndings are not well explained by an alternative account focused only on luck, because accidentally-replaced evidence activated the knowledge concept more strongly than did similar false belief cases (Experiment 3). We observed a consistent pattern of results across a number of different vignettes that varied the quality and type of evidence available to agents, the relative stakes involved, and surface details of content. Accordingly, the present ﬁndings establish basic phenomena surrounding people’s knowledge attributions in Gettier cases, and provide explanations of these phenomena within a Bayesian framework.},

This paper provides an overview of some of the results these researchers have uncovered, suggesting that in addition to traditionally considered factors like evidence and justiﬁcation, a number of important non-truth-conducive factors play signiﬁcant roles in determining when people ascribe knowledge. The present review focuses on four non-traditional factors: pragmatic load (in relation to contextualism and interest-relative invariantism), moral judgment, performance errors, and demographic variation.},

	abstract = {Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to overestimate in hindsight what one has known in foresight. Recently, two experiments extended the research to include samples from different cultures (Choi \& Nisbett, 2000; Heine \& Lehman, 1996). Asking their participants what they would have guessed before they knew the outcome (“hypothetical design”), Choi and Nisbett (2000) found that Koreans, in comparison to North Americans, exhibited more hindsight bias. Heine and Lehman (1996), however, reported that Japanese people in comparison to Canadians showed marginally less hindsight bias. In a second study, in which participants were asked to recall what they had estimated before they knew the outcome (“memory design”), the latter authors found no difference in hindsight bias between Japanese people and Canadians. We extended these studies with 225 Internet participants, in a hypothetical design, from four different continents (Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America). Hindsight bias was large and similar for all samples except for German and Dutch participants who showed no hindsight bias at all. While the latter effect may be based on peculiarities of the material and of the participants, the former underscores the worldwide stability of the phenomenon. In addition a follow-up surprise rating (paper and pencil) in China (35 participants) and Germany (20 participants) revealed that only less surprising items led to hindsight bias while more surprising ones did not. We suggest that the basic cognitive processes leading to hindsight bias are by-products of the evolutionary-evolved capacity of adaptive learning. On top of these basic processes, individual meta-cognitions (e.g., elicited by surprise) or motives (e.g., a self-serving motive) may further moderate the amount of bias, thus explaining the diverging results of Choi and Nisbett (2000), Heine and Lehman (1996), and our own study.},

In Study 1, we explored the impact of an individual's knowledge of technical terms on that person's ability to estimate other people's understanding of those terms. We assessed how individuals' familiarity with technical terms influenced their predictions that college freshmen and college graduates would understand those terms. Results indicate that familiarity with the meaning of technical terms leads to substantial overestimation of others' knowledge.

Although situations where the hearer’s knowledge is uncertain have seldom been addressed in the computational literature, they are common in ordinary communication, for example when a writer addresses an unknown audience, or when a speaker addresses a stranger. We propose a computational model composed of three complimentary heuristics based on, respectively, an estimation of the recipient’s knowledge, an estimation of the extent to which a property is unexpected, and the question of what is the optimum number of properties in a given situation. The model was tested in an experiment with human readers, in which it was compared against the Incremental Algorithm and humanproduced descriptions. The results suggest that the new model outperforms the Incremental Algorithm in terms of the proportion of correctly identiﬁed entities and in terms of the perceived quality of the generated descriptions.},

To understand learning contents appropriately, learners have to work on such lexical covers to gain insight into the underlying semantic meaning. It was assumed that a technical term’s origin (either German or classical Latin/ Greek) is used systematically as a hint for further elaboration. 41 college students rated the difficulty, familiarity, competence, accessibility, and their knowledge of 17 Germanlanguage ({GL}) terms and their classical language ({CL}) synonyms. The influence of word frequency was controlled. As expected, results showed that {GL} terms were perceived to be less difficult than {CL} terms. Consequently, comprehension of these terms was rated more highly. Analyses of how lexical encoding influenced accuracy of participants’ comprehension judgments showed that participants’ comprehension ratings were less accurate for {GL} terms.

The study described in this paper takes a step towards ﬁlling this gap by introducing an evidence-based approach for deriving adaptive interaction techniques. In a dialogue experiment with 36 dyads of computer experts and laypersons, we observed how experts tailored their written explanations to laypersons’ communicational needs. To support adaptation, the experts in the experimental condition were provided with information about the layperson’s knowledge level. In the control condition, the experts had no available information. During the composition of their answers, the experts in both conditions articulated their planning activities. Compared with the control condition, the experts in the experimental condition made a greater attempt to form a mental model about the layperson’s knowledge. As a result, they varied the type and proportion of the information they provided depending on the layperson’s individual knowledge level. Accordingly, such adaptive explanations helped laypersons reduce comprehension breakdowns and acquire new knowledge. These results provide evidence for theoretical assumptions regarding cognitive processes in text production and conversation. They empirically ground and advance techniques for adaptation of content in adaptive hypermedia systems. They are suggestive of ways in which explanations in recommender and decision support systems could be effectively adapted to the user’s knowledge background and goals.},

The emergence of such resources raises questions about the performance of expertise regarding the workings of algorithmic labor platforms. This article examines how Uber driver/bloggers—workers who are driving for Uber, while also creating Uber-related video content—perform expertise in driving for Uber on {YouTube}. I conducted in-depth interviews with 11 driver/bloggers and a qualitative analysis of the textual and video content published by driver/bloggers. Through the data, I show how driver/bloggers’ empowerment narratives became intertwined with their individualistic aspirations to develop dual careers as Uber drivers and {YouTubers}. Driver/bloggers employed three self-presentation strategies to perform expertise, including the construction of uniqueness and “know-how,” realness, and relatability with audiences. The study concludes with implications for our collective understandings of gig workers, expertise, and online curation across a wider platform ecology.},

The workplace is one sphere that is increasingly datafied. This study explores how Uber drivers, a form of digitally-enabled service workers, contribute to the normalization of the social production of space through their interpretative practices of digital data in an online forum. Drawing on Uber’s corporate discourse and an Uber driver online forum, we analyze two facets of the Uber app and drivers’ mediated experiences: (1) the quantification and discipline of drivers’ performance through Uber’s rating system and (2) the coordination of spatial movement through location-related metrics. We argue that the underlying workings of the Uber app premediate expectations of service encounters and spatial movement. Uber drivers meanwhile develop practices which respond to and circumvent their own data contributions to the system. Drivers’ practices, we argue, are largely in compliance with the calculative logics set by Uber. The article addresses implications of Uber drivers’ practices for the reproduction of social space and power-relations in digitally-enabled service work and the gig economy.},

Following a research through design approach, designers produce novel integrations of {HCI} research in an attempt to make the right thing: a product that transforms the world from its current state to a preferred state. This model allows interaction designers to make research contributions based on their strength in addressing under-constrained problems. To formalize this model, we provide a set of four lenses for evaluating the research contribution and a set of three examples to illustrate the benefits of this type of research.},

To further the paradigmatic development of educational {DR} we ask: how do we characterise the practical and theoretical products of {DR}? We propose that {DR} products are arguments for how people should learn. The theoretical products are design models in the form of blueprints, design arguments, and mockups, as well as principles and frameworks – all of which help designers create practical products to promote learning in the real world. Furthermore, the products of {DR} precipitate and build upon theoretical contributions from other fields in the natural sciences and ethics.

We present findings from our study that examines the relationship between humor and well-being, with social support serving as the mediator. The positive relationship between humor and well-being is explained through increased social support in the workplace. These findings suggest that conflicting results in the relationship between humor and well-being could be explained through the theory that only certain types of humor (such as positive humor) increase social support, and therefore well-being. These findings can be used to help employees and managers understand how to better use humor to have positive effects in the workplace.},

Here we report an analysis of spontaneous humorous speech in a rural Brazilian collective farm. The sample was collected over the course of ethnographic fieldwork in northeastern Brazil, and is drawn specifically from the monthly communal business meetings conducted in Portuguese. Our analyses focused on humorous utterances identified by the subsequent presence of laughter. Acoustic features of these utterances were compared to non-humorous utterances by the same speakers of similar length and immediately preceding them to look for prosodic contrasts. This corpus provided a unique opportunity for examining the way people mark their humorous productions in a non-humorous environment. Contrary to the notion that speakers must mark their production of humor in order to facilitate audience understanding, no significant marking of a joking “frame” was detected across a range of acoustic dimensions. The only consistent difference — that the set-up and punch line segments were louder than baseline speech before it — does not well support a marking hypothesis and more likely reflects speaker adjustments to the acoustic conditions of the meeting hall. We present these data from the perspective of the encryption theory of humor that predicts speakers will not generally mark spontaneous, conversational humor in most contexts.},

	abstract = {My article deals with responses to irony in two diﬀerent contexts. As an interaction analyst, I am interested in what interlocutors do with the ironic in the co-construction of the ongoing conversational sequence. Many reactions to an ironic act reveal that, in irony, a gap in evaluative perspective is communicated as the most central information. The said represents a perspective which is combined with a counter-perspective—the intended. Listeners can in principle react to both perspectives. Reacting to the said continues the play with clashing perspectives and conﬁrms the gap. I combine data analytic methods from interactional sociolinguistics with questions from cognition theory. I shall point out how an interaction analysis of diﬀerent responses to an ironic act contributes to the development of irony theory. A look at two data sets (informal dinner conversations among friends, and pro and con {TV} debates) provides interesting diﬀerences in responses to irony. From the format of the responses, we can often (though not always) access the processing of irony. If there are responses to the literal meaning, this does not necessarily indicate that the listener was not able to bridge the ironic gap (as former theories of irony have suggested), but most often that both the implicated and the literal message are processed. The data conﬁrm that there are deﬁnitely diﬀerent types of responses to irony: from responses to the literal level of the ironic act, to the implicated, mixed, or ambiguous reactions, to just laughter. The data further conﬁrm that the diﬀerent types of responses to irony create diﬀerent activity types. Responses to the literally said (the dictum) develop a humorous discourse type of joint teasing; they cultivate the clash of perspectives and are frequent in dinner table conversations among friends. In the context of pro and con debates, responses within the group diﬀer in accordance with the line of arguing. Here, responses to the implicatum are more frequent; they recontextualize the serious debate.},

Results reveal that certain types of content (some positive emotion words, task-related words), structural (verb tense, phrasal entrainment), and stylistic (emoticons) similarity characterize high trusting pairs while other types of similarity (e.g., negative emotion words) characterize low trusting pairs.

Understanding why and how this phenomenon happens is a prominent puzzle in the literature. To shed light on this puzzle, we propose and experimentally test one novel theory: through the salience of gender stereotype, a group's gender composition affects a person's willingness to lead a group, thereby impacting the group's overall performance. By randomly assigning people to groups with varying gender compositions, we find that women in mixed-gender groups are twice as likely as women in single-gender groups to suffer from the gender stereotype effect, by shying away from leadership in areas that are gender-incongruent. Further, we provide evidence that the gender stereotype effect persists even for women in single-gender groups. Importantly, however, we find that public feedback about a capable woman's performance significantly increases her willingness to lead. This result holds even in male-stereotyped environments.},

While most teams eventually encounter negative relationships, we have limited knowledge on how teams manage this negativity. In this article, we expand scholarship on teams by exploring an inherent team characteristic, gender composition, to assess its role in how teams cope with negative relationships. On the one hand, social role theory suggests that teams comprised of more women will perform better in the presence of negative relationships. On the other hand, theories and evidence on personality and individual differences suggest that teams comprised of more men will perform better in the presence of negative relationships. We studied 151 student project teams, and found that teams of mostly women performed better than teams of mostly men, when negative relationships existed among team members. We discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice.},

	abstract = {Real-time transcripts generated by automatic speech recognition ({ASR}) technologies hold potential to facilitate non-native speakers’ ({NNSs}) listening comprehension. While introducing another modality (i.e., {ASR} transcripts) to {NNSs} provides supplemental information to understand speech, it also runs the risk of overwhelming them with excessive information. The aim of this paper is to understand the advantages and disadvantages of presenting {ASR} transcripts to {NNSs} and to study how such transcripts affect listening experiences. To explore these issues, we conducted a laboratory experiment with 20 {NNSs} who engaged in two listening tasks in different conditions: audio only and audio+{ASR} transcripts. In each condition, the participants described the comprehension problems they encountered while listening. From the analysis, we found that {ASR} transcripts helped {NNSs} solve certain problems (e.g., “do not recognize words they know”), but imperfect {ASR} transcripts (e.g., errors and no punctuation) sometimes confused them and even generated new problems. Furthermore, post-task interviews and gaze analysis of the participants revealed that {NNSs} did not have enough time to fully exploit the transcripts. For example, {NNSs} had difficulty shifting between multimodal contents. Based on our findings, we discuss the implications for designing better multimodal interfaces for {NNSs}.},

We describe how the system was implemented in order to manage turn-taking and attention to users and objects in the shared physical space. We also discuss how multi-modal redundancy (from speech, card movements and head pose) is exploited to maintain meaningful discussions, given that the system has to process conversational speech from both children and adults in a noisy environment. Finally, we present an analysis of 373 interactions, where we investigate the robustness of the system, to what extent the system’s attention can shape the users’ turn-taking behaviour, and how the system can produce multi-modal turn-taking signals (filled pauses, facial gestures, breath and gaze) to deal with processing delays in the system.},

We discuss the potential contributions of this operational deﬁnition with respect to assessing and measuring the degree of embodiment in different biological and artiﬁcial systems. Second, we outline how this deﬁnition can be extended to lead to the particular notion of social embeddedness. Socially embedded agents are structurally coupled with their social environment, in that their sensorimotor activity is grounded in the social environment that the agent is surrounded by. Lastly, based on research in the social sciences on human–human interaction, we discuss perceptual requirements for interaction-aware robotic agents—agents whose identiﬁcation and interpretation of the (social) environment is facilitated by awareness of the structure of agent–agent interactions (including humans ‘in the loop’). We suggest relevant concepts and heuristics that can contribute to studies of degrees of embodiment of robots that interact with social environments. Manipulating and systematically investigating these heuristics permits variation of the degree of embodiment of such interaction-aware robots.},

To this aim, 82 female intermediate and upper-intermediate {EFL} learners were selected and taught some linguistic and socio-cultural aspects of English humor. Three researchermade questionnaires examined the effect of lexical and grammatical knowledge of the learners on their recognition, comprehension, and appreciation of English humor as well as the effect of humor instruction on the three variables. The results of two {MANOVA} analyses revealed that, unlike lexico-grammatical knowledge, familiarizing learners with structural and socio-cultural aspects of English humor could significantly influence the {EFL} learners' recognition, comprehension, and appreciation of English humor. This piece of finding might underscore the superior role of cultural factors over linguistic knowledge when dealing with {EFL} learners' humor comprehension and production; moreover, the instruction of sociocultural aspects of foreign language humor seems to be of higher importance compared with lexico-grammatical and linguistic aspects.},

The participants were 153 Iranian {EFL} learners at intermediate level of language proficiency who were randomly selected from English language learners from several English language institutes in Shiraz, Iran, and 30 American English native speakers who voluntarily participated in this study. A questionnaire consisting of six contextualized jokes of three major types of universal, cultural, and linguistic (with morphological, phonological, lexical, and syntactic subcategories) was developed based on Schmitz's (2002) classification of verbal humor to obtain the quantitative data. Moreover, a semi-structured interview was conducted to elicit the perception of those participants who did not find the jokes humorous. The results showed that the majority of Iranian {EFL} participants did not realize the humor in the jokes. Additionally, the findings revealed that generally speaking, Iranian {EFL} learners' perception of humor is significantly lower in all types of jokes examined. The best perceived type of humor was found to be the linguistic humor of morphological type for the Iranian {EFL} learners and the lexical type for English native speakers. It was also discovered that the phonological humor was the least perceived type of humor for both Iranian {EFL} learners and English native speakers.},

To address this problem, we conducted an online evaluation of 30 dialog jokes from different sources by almost 300 participants – volunteers and Mechanical Turk workers. We collected joke ratings along with participants’ age, gender, and language proficiency. Results show that demographics and joke topics can partly explain variation in humor judgments. We expect that these insights will aid humor evaluation and interpretation. The findings can also be of interest for humor generation methods in conversational systems.},

Our findings have implications for the design of systems that involve {AI} technologies in online self-presentation and chart a direction for future work that may upend or augment key aspects of Computer-Mediated Communication theory.},

Teams with better distribution of turn-taking have been found to outperform those with poorly distributed turntaking. Making teams aware of their turn-taking dynamics thus has the potential to improve their performance. This paper explores the use of a tangible interface as a means to both increase team members’ awareness of their turn taking dynamics, while actively driving the conversation towards more equivalent turntaking. The construction of a prototype called a {TurnTable} is detailed, as well as potential enhancements to the design to improve group performance.},

	abstract = {Can men and women have equal levels of voice and authority in deliberation or does deliberation exacerbate gender inequality? Does increasing women's descriptive representation in deliberation increase their voice and authority? We answer these questions and move beyond the debate by hypothesizing that the group's gender composition interacts with its decision rule to exacerbate or erase the inequalities. We test this hypothesis and various alternatives, using experimental data with many groups and links between individuals’ attitudes and speech. We find a substantial gender gap in voice and authority, but as hypothesized, it disappears under unanimous rule and few women, or under majority rule and many women. Deliberative design can avoid inequality by fitting institutional procedure to the social context of the situation.},
